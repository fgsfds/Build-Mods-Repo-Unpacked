Description             : Duke is enjoying semi-retirement.
			  Unfortunately this is ruined by a
			  spate of explosions occuring in the
			  old part of the city nearby.

			  In this map, Duke must board a plane
			  and parachute to the diving bell, in
			  order to reach the bad guy's base...
			  although things have a nasty habit of
			  not going the way you want them to.

Additional Credits	: Aleks, for input on visuals that I
			  100% did not listen to.
