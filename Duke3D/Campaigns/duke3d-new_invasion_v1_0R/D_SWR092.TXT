Description             : Duke is enjoying semi-retirement.
			  Unfortunately this is ruined by a
			  spate of explosions occuring in the
			  old part of the city nearby.

			  In this map, Duke must make his way to
			  the church on the city outskirts, but
			  the only way is through the sewers.

Additional Credits	: CK3D for attempting to replicate a bad
			  crash the map was suffering.
