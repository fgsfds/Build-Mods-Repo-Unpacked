Description             : Duke is enjoying semi-retirement.
			  Unfortunately this is ruined by a
			  spate of explosions occuring in the
			  old part of the city nearby.

			  In this map, Duke enters the under-sea
			  base of the bad guy, but the way
			  forward is fraught with danger. Who is
			  behind this and, more importantly, can
			  we kick his ass!?

Additional Credits	: Billy Boy, for actually releasing a
			  level with overlapping windows, the
			  same day I divised them independently
			  in Blood, back in 1999.
