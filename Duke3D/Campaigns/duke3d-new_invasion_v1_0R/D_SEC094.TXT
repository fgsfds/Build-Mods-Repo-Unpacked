Description             : Duke is enjoying semi-retirement.
			  Unfortunately this is ruined by a
			  spate of explosions occuring in the
			  old part of the city nearby.

			  With the boss having fled, you enter
			  a second simulator and find yourself
			  in a forest, but things aren't quite
			  as they first appear.

Additional Credits	: Ms. S.P. even if you are a disgusting
			  misandrist bitch. Hatred is a powerful
			  emotion sometimes.
