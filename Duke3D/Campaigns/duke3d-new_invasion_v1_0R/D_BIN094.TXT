Description             : Duke is enjoying semi-retirement.
			  Unfortunately this is ruined by a
			  spate of explosions occuring in the
			  old part of the city nearby.

			  In this map, Duke finds himself alone
			  in a hospital. Perhaps things aren't
			  quite as they seem. Something is wrong
			  here, but I can't quite place it.

Things I like		: The house stack
			  Counting how many tugs it takes to cum

Things I don't like	: The level is inherently ugly in places


Important Notes         : Cheats may render the map impossible
			  to complete. Notably, DNUNLOCK will
			  totally break the machines. This has
			  the effect of trapping you in the
			  level forever.
