                  If you post it on your web page, please tell me you've done
                  it so I can appreciate...

Misc.Author Info: I'm French (sorry for my English)

Other Levels    : Roch, Roch2, Roch3, Roch_sc1, Roch4, Roch5, Roch6, Roch7.

Other stuff     : DukeRoch, a Windows Duke3d launcher, which also allows you
                  to test all Duke3d sounds and musics, browse and test .GRP
                  files, and more... Now includes and supports Nolfb.com by Ken
                  Silverman, allowing you to play in Vesa mode under NT/2000/XP.

Description     : My 9th map. The 8th in the series - Roch_sc1 and sc2 will
                  be secret levels in the episode if I finish it someday.

                  Some cool effects/tips & tricks
                  Especially all spriteworks quite low on the floor that Duke
                  won't automatically step on (yet, you still can jump over them),
                  teleportation called by a switch, small and thin spriteworks.
                  Others that you may not notice...
                  This map has been made with no stuff, no ideas from any other
                  mapper. I guess that really needs to be said nowadays....

                  3 secret places.

                  If you love this map like I do and would like to know where
                  all secrets are, mail me to get a demo file that shows
                  everything (or to be sent my previous / future levels).

Tips            : Like in ROCH7, the gameplay is unlinear, using the same blue card
                  and 5 red switch/monitor sets controlling the intermediate goal.

                  Of course, don't even try to kill the first minibosses at
                  the beginning. Just run to reach the other side of the truck.
                  You'll be helped by some atoms on your way.

                  Someone will 'help' you behind some doors that don't open and
                  will give you the blue keys. While you were running at the
                  beginning, you lost the end yellow key that you found in Roch7.
                  An alien grabbed it and of course he's gone back with the key,
                  in that thing in the street.... Now you have to retrieve it to
                  get out of this eighth part (or was it the seventh?).

I love demos! Please, make me a favour: record one in any of my maps and send
it to me. Thanks for all those I received so far! It helps me see how I can
improve the gameplay since not one of you played the same style!

Authors MAY NOT use this level as a base to build additional levels,
concatenations, or otherwise. You MAY NOT use anything from this map or from
my previous maps without my permission. Anyway, try to create something of
