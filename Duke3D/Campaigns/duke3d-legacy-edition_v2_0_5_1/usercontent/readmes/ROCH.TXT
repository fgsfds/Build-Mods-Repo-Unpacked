                    (PLEASE send me any comments about this map)
Web Page          : none
Misc. Author Info : I'm French (excuse for my English!)
                    I started making "wads" for Doom (and I DON'T like Quake!)

Other Levels      : others, never distributed
Description       : A large city with cars, supermarket, cinema, dancing,
                    arcades, service station, a carousel, appartments, etc.
                    13 secrets (some are large and nice places, find them!)

Tips and tricks   : Please try to play this map without cheating for keys
                    or so. Ways and keys are not very hard to find! For all
                    secrets, there is a sign to help!
                    All control screens show different places, nearly all secret
                    places are shown in one of them.
                    If you love this map like I do and would like to know all
                    secrets, e-mail me to get a demo file that shows everything.
                    Once again, feel free to e-mail me for any comments.

=====================================================================

*Important Information*

Installation           : Unzip ROCH.MAP in your Duke3d directory, then
                         type : duke3d map roch <Enter>

IMPORTANT NOTES        : This map is very large (near 400K / 1023 sectors)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~          Run it in MS-DOS mode (NOT within Windows) if you 
                         have a small configuration (under 200Mhz / 32Mo RAM)
                         or game will slow down very much !
