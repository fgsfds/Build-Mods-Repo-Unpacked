Description: 

A rather large, mostly outdoor map, designed for classic duke and taking full advantage of the new build limits. 
So expect some big outdoor locations and the freedom to roam and stroll around a lot. ;) 
It's a little similar to some old maps of ours: red2 and maads, but of course the design is much more refined.
(there are even a few small nods to those maps if you look carefully enough, like anyone cares enough to look for
it anyway :P).

Since the map uses the new limits you'll need Eduke to play it!

(NOTE: the map tends to crash sometimes when using JonoF so always use EDUKE!!!
 in case you haven't downloaded Eduke yet: http://wiki.eduke32.com/stuff/ - get the latest snapshot)

Important information:

Singleplayer: 		yes
deathmatch: 		yes (*)
co-op: 			yes (**)
difficulty settings:    yes! Come get some is a lot more challenging.
new sounds: 		yes
new music: 		no
new cons: 	 	no
record camera's: 	yes
Requires atomic pack: 	yes
Requires ports: 	YES! Like we said: you'll need EDUKE to play this map!

(*) DM takes place at the hotel and it's surroundings, because the entire map would be way too big for a dm-match.
At the original start there's a big switch, opening a teleporter. This wil take you to the DM-area. 

(**)About CO-OP: While you're playing, some teleporter(s) will open right at the start. So in case you die,
              you don't have to walk the entire way again. Just hop into the teleporter and jump right 
	      back into the action!	
  IMPORTANT:  The first teleporter opens as soon as you walk over the road in front of the hotel.
	      The second one doesn't open until the very end.

Story:

One fine day Duke gets, yet again, a phonecall from the general. And of course Duke was just trying to enjoy
a well-earned vacation at that particular moment.
After kicking alien asses for about a zillion times, it's getting on Duke's nerves and he's asking himself 
why those stupid aliens can't just finally leave earth alone for at least one second. 
Oh well. Waiting for new, fresh alien races might take forever. Guess he has to be satisfied with what
he gets.

About 20 minutes later, Duke greets his general and sits down.
"So, what is it this time, sir?"
"Well", the general replies, "are you familiar with that fastfood-franchise 'The rock'?" 
"The rock? What.."
"I believe you've seen the name during your previous mission?"
"Erm - yes I have sir. There was no way of escaping that name. Besides, those darn bastards are beating my 
dukeburgers when it comes to sales!"
"Well it turns out that this company is owned and run by those alien bastards."
".. w- what? Why are they running restaurants? That doesn't make sense.."
"Well.. We don't really know yet."
"Heh, maybe they'll try to poison us with shitty hamburgers? Hehe.."
"It's not funny Duke! This is an alarming situation for sure. Think about it. Many people eat fastfood
every day. Aliens controlling such an important and daily source of human food.. that can't be good." 
"Hmm yeah.. guess so."
"Right now we're destroying every building that has 'The Rock' written on it. We can't take any risks when it
comes to those nasty aliens."
"True. So.. where do I fit in?"
"We need you to find their headquarters, and we think we know where to find it."
The general hands out a map to Duke and continues:
"You have to search this coastal area, most importantly the hotel at the top of the cliff. We suspect that 
it's their headquarters, or maybe the gateway to their headquarters. There's a lot of alien activity around
that area. Hopefully you'll find out what their exact plans are and put an end to it. 
There's a helicopter ready to take you near enough."
"Allright, that should be a piece of cake.. Now let's ro.."
"One more thing duke."
"What?"
"If you see any "The rock" building that's somehow still intact, don't hesitate and please destroy it."
"Now THAT is the kind of news I like! Let's ro.."
"Good luck then, Duke!"
"....ck"

A last note:

In our opinion this map looks best when it's played with classic duke. But of course it's entirely up to you wether
you play it with hi-res or not. :-)

Have fun!
