Description             : Just like every night it's porn time for Duke (what a fucking lonely loser) when
                          suddenly he hears a huge crash and explosions and the usual whatnot across the street. Feeling
                          quite bitter for having been interrupted in the process of successfully releasing
                          his body fluids, Duke switches hands to grab his gun and gets the fuck outside to rip
                          whoever the culprit of his upcoming blue balls is a new asshole. Hmm, looks like those aliens
                          bastards have chosen their time right to take over that one porn complex accross the street. After
                          killing a couple of them Duke decides it's time to finish his job (wait... which one ?).

                          ALL IN ALL
                          DIS IZ A FUCKIN GRATE CITY MAP LOL!!!

                          JUMP

                          Who did what : Maarten built the sewers and the back alley that leads to them, as well as the room
                          with the second blue card, and a rough sketch of the main street I later polished, trimmed,
                          re-textured etc. He also threw in some extra detail and eye-candy ie. 'real' holes behind exploded
                          fire extinguishers, he made a couple of doors etc., stuff I wouldn't have been arsed to build
                          myself.
                          As for me I built most of the indoor areas (the Nancsi Pleaser complex, apartment building etc.),
                          reworked pretty much 100% of the outdoor areas, turned what Maarten had originally intended as
                          a small bar into an arcade room. I also did the unreachable areas / landscape, implemented the
                          gameplay that was later fine-tuned by Maarten, Merlijn and Methunter, and as a whole threw in all
                          the detailing and shading.

Additional Credits to   : Corentin 'Methunter' and Merlijn 'Mrline' van Oostrum for their detailed beta reports. Special
                          thanks to Methunter for his quality feedback from the start and a lot of ideas (ie. he built a
                          rough sketch of the first roof that turned out to be one of the coolest places in the whole map
                          after we polished it, also the old video games in the arcade room were originally his idea)

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch.
Build Time              : Well I started the map one month and a half ago just for kicks and built the first couple of
                          sectors, but we only really started to be active on it a couple of weeks later. All in all I say
                          we really spent maybe three weeks on it, we got some fast progress on this one.
Editor(s) used          : JonoF Build and Mapster32.
Known Bugs / Problems   : Nothing major.
May Not Run With...     : Duke Nukem 3D 1.3d. You don't even need JonoF or Eduke32 to play this one, it doesn't break the
                          old Build limits.
