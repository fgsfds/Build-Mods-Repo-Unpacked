Misc. Author Info     : Videogame lover in general and First Person Shooters in my particular. 
                        Duke Nukem is probably my favorite game of my childhood as I played it a lot on the Nintendo 64 when I was a kid.

Other Levels          : Some shitty levels that I did when I was learning to build, this are the less shitty (but still noob maps): 
                        "Sector VII", "Ruinas" and "Europe".	

Description           : This is a very big outdoors map containing various locations such as some temples, caves, volcano, cementery, colisseum... 
                        The map focuses on two concepts: exploration and intense action.  
                        There are no puzzles or thinking, just find the keys and make it to the end while exploring the different locations of the map.
