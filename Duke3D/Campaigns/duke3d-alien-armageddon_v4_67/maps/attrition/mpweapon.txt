Description             : In Operation Kolpowitz (mpkolp.map) Duke
			shot down the alien mothership, but still 
			the alien invasion hasn't been stopped.
			Intelligence suspected that the heart of the
			invasion lay somewhere in the Rocky Mountains,
			because that's where all the bastards are
			coming from. 
	
			Satellite pictures show that there is somekind
			of plant, hidden in the mountains. A marines
			team sent there hadn't been able to enter the
			facility. The last they heard from them is
			that it is a weapon factory.

			Colonel: "This activity must be stopped at
			once. You will be dropped near the site in the
			Rockies and it is up to you to see if there is
			anyone alive out there. We expect they're all
			dead, but just for the record. If you're able
			to enter the facility, try to shut it down,
			but watch your back! We need you back alive,
			Duke!"

			Duke: "Let's rock!"
