Description           : Duke is sent to Galbadia to investigate claims of a secret alien hive nearby,
the purpose of which is believed to be using captured local babes to breed 
alien drones. Duke rents an apartment near the central park and takes a shit. 
Upon learning of Duke's presence, the hive Overlord commands his troops to 
seize the town as a means to protect the hive. Next thing you know, you've
got Recon Cars circling the park while an alien breach squad is on its way 
to your apartment. Your task is to locate the hive and kill the Overlord.

* Construction *

Base                   : New level from scratch
Level Editor(s) Used   : Mapster 
Construction Time      : The map started years ago, I (MetHy) built the square area in the middle of the map in 2006 (I think). 
			 Then I slowly started building bits and pieces around it.
			 At some point Steambull joined the project and we kept sending the map back&forth after we'd made a room or building. 
			 Can't remember when that exactly was (2008-2009 I think). We started losing interest at some point. 
			 In 2011 I asked MRCK and Mikko Sandt if they'd like to join in to make a couple of rooms.
			 They both made an apartment in that apartment building (MRCK also made some of the corridor).
			 After that I took the map back and built a couple more things.
			 Here we are now in 2012, and thanks to Mikko Sandt who once again picked up the map, tied the loose ends together and finished the unfinished:
			 It's finally done, 6 years after the first area was built.
