Important Notes         : This was built with EDuke32 in mind with the OpenGL Polymost renderer.
			  Classic 8-bit should work fine as well (looks best actually). However, Polymer will
			  most likely melt your fucking computer and cause a nuclear explosion.

			  HRP (High Resolution Pack) has not been tested. Use it at your own risk.

Installation            : Unzip the contents of the .ZIP into the root folder of EDuke32.
