Power Unlimited: the best snow map for 2001 (Kef: grr the fuckers.. there has only been released one!)
Pc Gamer 4/10  : Very good looking map but I didn't like the design.

*Important Information*

Installation           : Stick it up.

Important Notes        : This might be my last Duke map! Why? Because if I will lose my hand on 31 December '01 I will not be 
			 able to build anymore! Poor me.. otherwise.. umm you'll see :P

Important Notes (2)    : This is the only SERIOUS message in whole this TXT file!! In the beginning.. if you don't know what	
			 to do.. I have the solution for you :P Go to the "boxes"... yes there are two somewhere near a 			 building (no.. not the distructable barrels!) press space at one of them.. or both whatever and
			 Duke will move the barrels to the building.. this way you can get up.. isn't that a neat effect?

Note to reviewers      : Plz don't say I used someone else's style because I didn't.
