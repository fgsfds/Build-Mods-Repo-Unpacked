Level Info  	      : Aliens have decided to grab a beer at a modernised British pub in Lynnchester called The Flaming
			Shipwreck, slaughtering the local folk and causing all sorts of trouble. Being too much for the
			local police force, Duke has been assigned to remove their presense from the area.

			Originally started as a pub section for the BeachCBP during Apr 2013. Having no motivation for
			mapping at the time, it was put aside indefinitely. I resumed work in Nov 2014 with a different
			perspective and workflow to mapping. To ensure a healthy balance of motivation and inspiration,
			there were various short and long breaks inbetween. Project finished 24th Aug 2015.
