Introduction          : Orbital Oblivion; Level 6.
			After a turbulent ride blasting asteroid
			debris, Duke finally reaches the moon and
			finds a small launch pad to land.
			To the unsuspecting Duke, human activity has
			recently been detected (according to his
			spaceship radar), although he finds no
			discernable human for his reception. So he
			goes scouring for some life while he guards
			himself.
Description           :	Large level subdivided between the moon
			surface and underground reachable by
			means of the two present subways.
