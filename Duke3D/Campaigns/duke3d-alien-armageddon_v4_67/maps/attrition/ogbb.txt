History
of the map	: William Gee:
                  Well iv wanted to build a map with anather person for agees and ive always
		  wanted to build one with Mrline cause he also builds large areas so I asked lol ;)
                  He sent me a map he had already started had about 20 sectors and some nice
                  spritework, so i built on it strait away and sent it back that day :D Then
                  We discussed what the storyline should be and both of us agreed that it
                  should be something commicle/stupid (none seriouse) So we came up with
                  "Operation get back bike" ;) Then Marrtn joind in aswell so the project
                  was off with a shot. I personaly found this map more enjoyable buiding on
                  than anything i have ever built!

		  Mrline:
		  Somewhere in Januari I wanted to do something aside to red4 and I started
		  a map wich supposed to be a city-themed dm map . But after I made 1 building
	          (the first one with the sprite balconies) I stopped building on it :P
		  Until months later (after red4 was released) William suggested to make a map
		  together. I liked the idea and suddenly rembered the dm-map, so I sent it to
		  him lol. He liked it and immidiately built a huge part on it wich looked
		  awesome! I was like: wow this is going to be great! :D
		  After that, the ridicilous story was made up and my brother joined.
		  Progress was going very fast, sometimes I recieved the map back after 1 day
		  allready!! I personally really loved working on this map, it was great fun
		  and I really love the results!!
		  Big challenge 4 me was making a shop without the 1.4 shop-textures lol.

		  Maartn:
		  Well, what can I say now lol? :P I did join with this project cuz I really
		  liked the idea to build a city map together with William and Mrline ;) Also I
		  wanted to build something else again after all that alien shit I made
		  in Alien planet X64-2 (you can find some familair thingz of it though :D).
		  The really funny thing of this map was we sent the map to each other all the
		  time and built something free what we like, so without plans! And I think
		  the results are great! Personlly I love the map :) Also you really can see
		  the different styles of our 3 :) I almost can't believe we did finish a quite
		  big city already in 3 months! It was going really fast (somethime a small
		  break though). Also, nobody knew anything of this map before which was funny.
		  To give the map a litle extra I made that sound of the band metallica lol :)
		  I loved to work on this map!

		  Play this map now! :)
