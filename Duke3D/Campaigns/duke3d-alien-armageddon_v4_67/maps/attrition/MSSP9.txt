Title                 : MSSP 9 - New Pietniemi

Author                : Mikko Sandt

Web Page              : https://msdn.duke4.net   

Misc. Author Info     : Finnish mapper, widely recognized - along with my sidekick, the Gambini - 
			as the greatest Duke3D mapper ever. A copy of DNF2013, stored on a golden 
			USB flash drive, will be placed onboard a future space probe that will 
			transmit the greatest works and knowledge of humankind to the farthest
			reaches of the known universe. 
                     

Other Levels          : Too many to mention here. There's the MSSP series, the Brave New World 
                        mod, Earth Base, Dukecide, etc. In addition I have contributed maps to 
                        various projects such as Duke Nukem Forever 2013 (as co-author) and the 
			AMC TC.

Installation/running  : Run EDuke32 and select the map from the usermap menu. The map probably
                        works without EDuke32 too, in which case you can launch it via Setup.exe. 
			If you're using Megaton, subscribe to the map, then launch the game and 
 			search for the map in the workshop menu (if it's not there, restart Steam).

Plot                  : The aliens have invaded one of the many human colonies on the Moon, this
			one inhabited mostly by Finnish settlers from Pori. The Finns fought fiercely, 
			but every inhabitant was slaughtered eventually. Rather than allowing the 
			aliens to establish a Lunar beachhead, Duke is sent to destroy the colony's 
			fusion reactor, an act that should wipe out the entire colony and the alien 
			presence there.


Level Info  	      : The map was "quickly" put together for my site's (https://msdn.duke4.net) 
			20th anniversary. I failed to make the initial deadline (21st of April), 
 			but here we are, one week later, with a finished map. I probably should have
			kept it for another week or two in order to put more stuff in it, but hey, 
			it's the principle that matters!

  			The map is based on the "New LA" concept by George W. Bernard, the legendary
			author of Last Reaction & Water Bases TC. I built another map based on the 
			concept back in 2003 for my Brave New World mod. The AMC TC also has "New LA" 
                        themed stuff in it.

			A few more notes: Shading is meant to look good rather than correspond to the 
			position of the Sun in the sky. Also, you'll notice that there are no crates 
			or boxes to fill empty space. And don't spend too much time wondering whether 
			the Lunar "atmosphere" is really breathable (as a result of terraforming) or 
			whether the area is actually surrounded by forcefields (as in E2L8 after they 
			ditched the spacesuit inventory item). In case you're wondering about the name, 
			Pietniemi is the "hood" where I grew up.

			A special version with "modern" lighting is planned for the 20th Anniversary World 
			Tour edition of the game, so keep your eyes on the game's Steam Workshop section.
