Description: Richard Cranium Mining Company has uncovered an ancient alien relic deep within their Beta tunnel, and is holding it underground inside their processing facility, Polaris. It wouldn't be long until the aliens reached the company and began turning it inside-out looking for their artifact. Fearing the unknown capabilities of this relic and the lives that were at stake, the EDF has sent Duke in to retrieve the relic and purge all alien life within the facility, something he's completely willing and capable of doing.

===Abstract=== 
Map time to complete (Knowing layout): ~20-25 minutes
Map time to complete (New player): ~30-45 minutes
Large number of enemies (300+), ten secrets, ammo and health is moderate, but sufficient enough to get the job done. There are even secrets within the map that aren't mentioned or credited so don't be afraid to dnclip around ;). Also, try looking for the 5 switches that unlock the secret armory underground. You don't have to cheat to find them but they are hidden well, so be on the look-out!

---Developer Note----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a map I've been working on occasionally for over a year but I've finally been granted the time to just sit down and complete it! Special thank you to everyone who supported me in the making and release of this map! I Hope you all enjoy! And feel free to give the multiplayer a try through Meltdown or Megaton!
