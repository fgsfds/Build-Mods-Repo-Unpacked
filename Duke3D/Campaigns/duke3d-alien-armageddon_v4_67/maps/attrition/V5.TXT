Misc. Info          :  For vers. 1.4 or 1.5 of duke only.  Sorry.  If you only
                       have version 1.3(upgrade) otherwise e-mail me, and I may convert
                       this level to 1.3, if enough people want it.

Description         :  Duke makes an impromtu landing into the alien moonbase.
                        

Note                :  This is the third level in an episode which will contain
                       6+ levels.  If you don't have the first or second level 
                       or you want me to put you on my e-mail list to recieve my future 
                       levels you pay absolutely nothing all I ask is that you e-mail me
                       to let me know what you think. I thrive on feedback so the more 
                       I get the more inclined I am to make levels you want to play.

Episode and Level # :  episode 4(USER MADE EPISODE) LEVEL 3
Single Player       :  Yes
DukeMatch  Level    :  YES, but it's pretty big, so bring atleast 3 friends
Difficulty Settings :  YES

* Construction *    :  New level from scratch
Known Bugs          :  none.  The opening sequence is kinda intense, and will
                       bring lesser machines to their knees(you'll survive).  I know this because
                       I have a lesser machine.  But for higher end users(Pentium 90 and above,
                       (like I said I have a lesser machine) It'll be intense)
