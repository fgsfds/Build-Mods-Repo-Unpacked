Misc. Author Info     : Duke King from Finland who has been killing aliens with Duke since -96. 
                     

Other Levels          : Mssp1-Mssp7, O'Boy, Dm1-Msdm5, Duke Tournament TC, three versions 
			of MSSP Episode, Brave New World mini-mod, some crappy newbie levels
                        and then I took part in CBP1, 2, 3, 5 & 6 projects. I have also made
			a level for Unreal Tournament & Quake 3 Arena (and working on a Doom 3
                        level). 

Description           : Typical city level - more city style than O'Boy was (which was over 50%
                        hi-tech). One of my favorite levels. Some of the credit belongs to Taivo
                        who brought up the conversation about some unreleased Community Build 
                        Project which forced me to dig up my part for that particular CBP out of
                        the grave and continue it. The first street area with a few rooms is from
                        the unreleased CBP. 
		
		        I built about 70% of the level within a week. I had lots of inspiration.
                        Then I stopped just so that I could wait for another 'Build Spree' - when
                        it got to me I slowly finished the rest of the level. 

                        I made a mini-mod for Duke3D which was released during the first hours of
                        the year 2004. The mod is named Brave New World and it features five kick-ass
			levels and a bunch of new stuff. Check it out at http://www.planetduke.com/msdn/bnw.shtml

			Sidenote: I spent the last 1.5 hours of the the mssp8-building process trying
                        to make a 'teleport elevator' to work. It didn't. I had this problem with O'Boy
                        as well. So when I had enough of it I just replaced it with a 'silent teleport' 
                        thing. 

                        Sidenote 2: The 14th of November - today - is my 20th Birthday. So instead of 
                        asking for presents I just give them - Enjoy!

Plot                  : "Insert some stupid excuse for mindless killing here"
