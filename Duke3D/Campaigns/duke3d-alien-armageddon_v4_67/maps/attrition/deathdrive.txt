"DEATH DRIVE", a 5-level action-packed episode, product of speedmapping and anger.
 
"DEATH DRIVE" takes inspiration mostly from classic levels of "L.A. Meltdown" and a few other
sources like 'Metropolitan Mayhem" and "Hotline Miami". The main focus of the episode is levels with classic vibe packed
along with challenging and fastpaced action of my own map "Slaughterfest". 
I always felt like the original game does not provide player an actual challenge so I slightly modified 
the USER.CON (so that the monsters deal a bit more damage)
Recommended difficulty is Come Get Some (GET PSYCHED!) just as usual.
Enjoy the show!

note: Funny thing about this whole episode is that while the actual development took me 2-4 days for each map,
finishing the episode took a few months due to a few complications in life. 

Additional Credits      : 
Bobby Prince (doom music I used)
Megadeth (for the amazing grabbag they made)
People behind music for 1997 game Blood
Sanek (indirect source of inspiration)
Lee Jackson (RoTT music)
