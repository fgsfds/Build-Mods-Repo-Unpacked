Title			: Bank Roll 2000
Filename		: bankroll2000.map
Author			: arzca

Previous Releases	: Mostly some lame maps back in 2000-2003. Retired
			  from Duke mapping in 2004. Since then I've made
			  only few maps for Duke, most of which were the
			  kind of maps I won't probably release. Fortunately,
			  this is one of the better ones...:)

Description		: This level is a remake of 3D Realms' legendary
			  Bank Roll (E3L2). The map is being very loyal
			  to it's original version, layout is rougly the
			  same as it was in E3L2. However, there are new
			  areas, grocery stores, stripclubs, new secrets
			  etc. I tried to make this map as unlinear as
			  possible, meaning that majority of the map
			  can be accessed by alternative means (DM). This
			  map provides a lot more challenge than the
			  original E3L2 (obviously) in single player, and
			  don't forget Co-op. I added items for
			  that purpose as well.

			  There used to be flying RPV's out on the streets,
			  but with Megaton Edition, they seemed to get stuck
			  regularly, rendering them into sitting ducks
			  so I removed them. This map was created by using
			  mapster32 for Eduke32, where to those RPV's were
			  working fine.

Additional Credits to: 3d Realms for this old, very simple but damn good shooter.
		       Big thanks also for Duke community for keeping this
		       game alive. Also, Mikko Sandt deserves credit for feedback.

Known Bugs/Problems	: 
			  Sometimes when player jumps to grab the freezer, it
			  is possible to "teleport" at the Blue Access Card room,
			  due to their close proximity of the rooms (sector-over-sector).
			  Beating the map is not possible if this bug occurs, unless
			  you posess Yellow access card. Save your game before you grab
			  that Freezethrower. Try not to jump too high when grabbing the
			  Freezer.
