Story
-----
Duke was sent to an EDF base in the orbit of Earth, called
"YMF500G" and while he was doing a test mission the base
was attacked by aliens, so they disconnected the radio
systems and killed all the people in the base (except
Duke, of course :P). So, Duke must reconnect the
communication systems to get help from Earth.
