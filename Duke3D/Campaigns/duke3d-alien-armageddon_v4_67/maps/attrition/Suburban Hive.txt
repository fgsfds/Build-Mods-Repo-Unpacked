Title                   : SUBURBAN HIVE

Date Finished           : February 10th, 2010

Filename                : Suburban Hive.map

Description             : Big ass snow city / alien-themed map with hectic firefights and plenty of locations to explore.

                          This is a "2-hour community build project" which means that it was designed by a bunch of different
                          experienced mappers who had their time limited to 2 hours to build their section. Scroll down for
                          a short description of who build what if you are interested, and if you aren't, just go play the
                          level and kick major ass.

Misc. Author Info       :


MRCK :
I started the project and built the first area with the weird colored crystal things, the random fires, the Foot Locker
thing and most importantly, the alienish-looking building that's probably the biggest and most unique-looking element in
my part. I hadn't mapped in a while so I was expecting the results to turn out kinda random (especially given the time
restriction) and I thought I would just go nuts with the theme. Thankfully the next mappers managed to maintain the level
of originality / dorkiness, and in the end the map looks way more consistent and plays much better than I thought it would.
I got the map back a couple of days before its release and was surprised with the results, so I took the time to polish
everyone else's section aligning forgotten textures / shading walls / adding ambient sounds / fixing bugs / retexturing stuff
to make it all look even more solid, pretty hectic but it was worth it if you ask me. In the end I think it made for a really
good level, especially considering the format of the mapping process, and how random the original theme started out.

Mrline :
I lost count of the CBP's I participated in, but I can tell you that my part is the entrance to the weird big alienship-thingy
and its first room. My part ends at the big door, from there Mikko Sandt takes over. MRCK basically said I could make it as
weird-looking as I wanted, and it surely looks a bit different then your average alien spaceship. I enjoyed working on it and
it's probably my best effort in speedmapping yet. Enjoy!

Mikko Sandt :
My part is the second half (the part after the Battlelord door) of the alien base/spaceship Merljin built. It has three rooms
with the "cycler hallway" in the middle. I was a bit reluctant at first to carry on with the theme Merljin established in his
part. I'm glad I decided to go with it, considering the fact that I haven't done this theme since MSSP2. I was so glad with
the way my part turned out in just two hours that I wanted to build a usermap around it.

MetHy :
Yet another contribution of mine in a CBP whereas I have yet to release my own first full Single Player map
(although this day might come soon)... I built the City part after the Alien ship at the beginning of the map, the one
mixing the themes of snow, alien and (blue) crystals which were already used previously in the map. I thought I was
inspired and if you ask me, it's the part best I've done in a CBP along side what I did in JFCBP002. Enjoy.
(MetHy also added the gameplay - monsters and items - in the whole map on the day before its release - the whole process
took him a whole day, but the results are great)

Maartn :
My part is the city with train station behind the forcefield next to Merlijn alien spaceship. I enjoyed working on it, I
would've loved to add more details but the way it is now is fine too. Like all the other CBP's I've taken part in, it was very
fun to built for. 

The Commander :
This is the second CBP I have taken part in and a great one at that if I may say so myself. My part is from the force field
beside the Foot Locker to the first underwater tunnel. The green fog in the water was added after by DanM to help improve
the atmosphere of the map.

DanM :
My first CBP, I did the sewer section right after The Commander's underwater section, more of a survival / spooky place,
It was nice to have a bit of a change from the city environments I am doing in Eternity right now . I rather enjoyed doing
this and would not mind doing another.

James Stanfield :
It's been a while since I took part in a CBP... I've actually taken part in the majority of them, and they are always
entertaining to see how they shape up. For my part I built a little club called 'Afterlife', very loosely inspired by the same
club featured in Mass Effect 2. It's very small but I'm happy with it.

Sanek :
I made a small, but nicely done part in basic 3DR style.

Forge :
I made the circular arena and the preceding short sewer area at the end. This is the third map I've worked on so two hours was
pretty constraining for my weaker skills compared to some of the more experienced participants. I may have had loftier goals,
but once time started flying by, I had to settle for a sloppier product than I would have liked.  If I ever do a timed map again,
it'll be at one sitting. Keeping track of time and also trying to figure out where I've left off when I've worked on it, left it,
worked on it, left it, etc. sucks, but the overall experience was enjoyable.
