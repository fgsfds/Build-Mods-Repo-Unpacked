Compatibility: EDuke32 (Jonof not tested) and Atomic Edition required.

Description: Quakis has started a zillion maps over the years and
finished only a fraction. Many of these unfinished pieces shared
a common theme. William Gee took the pieces that fit together and
assembled a map. However, the level was only about 60-70% finished
at that point. Upon receiving a bunch of unfinished levels from
Quakis, I noticed this map titled "QWG" and decided to do what I 
can to finish it. So I added a few new rooms, finished others (the
big railway hangar was the hardest since it was so huge but almost
completely empty at that point), added monsters, items and sounds
and so on.

This is now the second map (the first being "Hidden Zone") that has 
been mostly built by someone else but finished by me. I'm planning
on continuing finishing some unfinished stuff by various authors 
since it'd be such a pity to let all those great maps go to waste.

Anywayz, since Discarded Stronghold ("QWG") is a three-man project 
but only one person is writing this txt (Mikko) let's hear what the 
other two have got to say...

Quakis:
"William contacted me about merging maps from my "Final Pack" quite a while
back and working on a single level from it. I approved and it was worked on
for a short while. Eventually no progress was made, attempted to use it for
an episode of mine, but eventually got completely forgotten about like many
of my projects. I then brought the subject up with Mikko and he took the
task to finish off the map, which I'm thankful for."

William Gee:
"I wanted to finish Quakis projects by merging them all into one map, 
so I took a bunch of maps Quakis abandoned and released and merged 
them all together. Then I just added details game play and some of my 
own ideas n stuff. I didn't know Mikko was finishing it, at least I 
have forgotten, but thats cool I'm glad it is being completed and 
released. It was quite a good map while we were working on it. Go Duke!"

		
Story: EDF base has been overrun by aliens who are now looting the
base, searching for information that could jeopardize the existence
of mankind. Duke has been sent to investigate the base, or what's
left of it, and make sure that no alien survives.
