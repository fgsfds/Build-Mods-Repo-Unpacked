Description             : "That's one easy task!". Duke remembers
			himself thinking that. Now that he has blown
			a hole in a chemicals factory he discovers
			there are a lot more aliens than any one
			could have expected. So far for the easy
			assignment!

			Colonel: "Work your way through the factory
			and kill until the only organism alive is
			you. But look out! The hazardous chemicals
			won't hurt them, but they will hurt you!"

			Duke: "Let's get some!"
