_balley.map does not have a proper text file, so here is the review by Mikko Sandt instead:

23rd of May 2006

_balley | Single/DM | Author: Alias Conrad Coldwood

Stuff: From the author of Needle Time, _balley is a nice small city map. Imagine the most standard city map and there you have it. Design is above average with some good looking buildings and realistic lightning. It's a bit cramped but so are my maps and they are way worse than this (I actually used to rate my own maps Back In The Days - MSSP5 gained 95 from me - lel!). There's a comic book shop and a few other apartments but it's mostly outdoor/alley action. The gameplay floats like a leaf down the river of life. Shouldn't take you more than 5-10 minutes.
