Web page		: Coming soon :D (should mean the opposite to anyone out there knowing
			  me well enough to tell ^^)
Misc. Author Info       : 17-years-old skateboarder from France :P Plays the bass and screams in
			  a crappy fucked punk-hardcore band with no drummer. Proudly owns the
			  shittiest PC ever. Has been playing Duke with the default keyboard
			  settings for centuries (on the 3D Realms / DNF timescale). Spams on
			  AMC, then blames Supa Sang for being a bad butterfly killer. Should
			  get a life, instead of writing it down.

Description             : Very colorful, Roch-inspired city map. Considering the Dogville event
			  that happened a few months ago, I tried not to directly rip anything
			  from Roch but still, part of the credit goes to Pascal Rouaud. This map
			  has some nice innovations, you'll see :) There's lotsa cars,
			  nicely-designed buildings and plenty of action in a large gameplay
			  area. This map is likely to get a sequel one of those days.

			  The map is quite challenging the first time around (the way I like it),
			  but not frustratingly hard, really (when compared to my Spiegul map for
			  example). Just save often and everything will be OK :) I think Ive
			  balanced the gameplay pretty well this time.

			  The 'filler' name comes from the fact that I didnt put that much
		          effort into this map, I built it just for fun and decided to release
			  it... as filler, since it had been months since I last released
			  something :P And Minor Threat's Filler song just rocks. So I kept the
			  name ^^

			  Enjoy this kickass map :)

Additional Credits to   : Pascal Rouaud, for his amazing, very inspiring work. Ppl tends to
			  forget he's the one who first started to build 3D-chairs, thin
			  spritework, etc. so I had to acknowledge him for that. Check out
		 	  his Roch map series (assuming you havent yet, and thus are either a
			  n00b, or a fool. Or both - then you're either a n00bish fool or a
			  foolish n00b... or both. Argh goddamnit)
			  Taivo Maripuu, for making some of the best maps out there, which tend
			  to inspire me quite a lot.
			  Merlijn 'Mrline' van Oostrum, for being a great bloke making great
			  maps :P
			  Ryan 'Quakis' Rouse, for finding two totally unnoticeable
			  sprite bugs only to have his name stated here ^^
			  Kim Robinson aka the Repository Bloke - without his support since the
		          beginning, this map would never have seen the light of the day. Check
			  out the Duke3D Repository http://www.bur.st/~duke3d/
			  Brett Gmoser, Jonah Bishop, Steffen Itterheim, Klaus Breuer for their
			  early Build FAQs - they taught me everything.
			  Flogging Molly, for rocking.
			  Everyone I forgot (I think).
			  Oh, and me, because without me none of this would have been possible :P
			  And last but not least - my girlfriend, for being the best.

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from my ass. But fear not, it doesnt stink that much.
Build Time              : A month and a day
Editor(s) used          : Makemap
Known Bugs / Problems   : A couple sprite glitches, and some minor stuff here and there you 
			  hopefully wont even notice. Nothing major, really. Oh yeah and some
			  newbeasts seem to be able to run through some particular walls. Odd.
			  No real effect on gameplay tho. I could have fixed that bug by fucking
			  with the walls but that would have been a little painful :P (pun).
May Not Run With...     : Carl Lewis :P

Next maps by me        : Lotsa baby :P Ill remake some of my old maps (AC1-2-3, Downtown Ride)
			 and then I might start working on Rural Nightmare 2. And Ill prolly
			 make a Filler 2 map one day as well. Hmm. Or maybe I'll never make
			 any of those, and some others instead. Argh. I really dont know. Fuck
		         you :P
