Title                   : EDF Computer Base
Date Completed          : February 23 2011
Filename                : HT_EDF_V1.MAP
Author                  : Paul "High Treason" Monteray
Email Address           : PAU174u[at]aol.com
Misc. Author Info       : I like taking the "You can't do this
			  in Build." rule and destroying it.
Other Levels            : Preston Road

Description             : This is not the strongest map, I feel
			  I am better at outdoor areas, but I
			  had to try. This is a short map, you
			  have to get through the base using the
			  key cards and killing enemies as usual
			  at the end you have to blow up the big
			  computer before leaving. All in all, I
			  am not proud of most of the map, but
			  it was mostly an experiment and the
			  end is good in my opinion.

Additional Credits      : None... Except thanks to artists of
			  music I listened to whilst working on
			  this map. The Zombies are awesome!
