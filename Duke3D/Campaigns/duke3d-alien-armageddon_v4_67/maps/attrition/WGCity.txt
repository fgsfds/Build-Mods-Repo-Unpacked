Editor(s) used        : Mapster32
Known Bugs            : maybe some very small sprite bugs, hardly notice, Map is also very complexs at times it crashes
while in polymost mode, it seems to be random, useraly it never crashes. Im not aware of the reason.

* Where to get this MAP file *

maybe from these sites although im not 100% sure :P And of cause your all alowed to review it and add it to your own sites.
But hey, you already have it so why you wanna know anyway.
