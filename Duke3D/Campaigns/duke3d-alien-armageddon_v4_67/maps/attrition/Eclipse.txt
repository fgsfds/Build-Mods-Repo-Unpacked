Thanks to Joe Pusateri for some ideas.

=======================================================

The story goes something like this:
Duke was getting some R&R when his briefing officer interrupted him. The officer
said "Duke, we have a new problem. In a desperate last attempt to steal all of
our chicks, the aliens captured our last moonbase. They used  their best troops,
so they will be harder to kill. The base was used to monitor military activity
on earth, and if the aliens get it, they will be able to get all of the playboy
channels for free. We need you to stop them! And please, Duke, don't go around
breaking everything like you usually do!" After duke finished his R&R he got his
sunglasses on and got in his shuttle. As he takes off he thinks "hmm... looks
like it's time for an eclipse." On the final approach the aliens shot down his
ship, sealing their fate.

Visit areas like the famous "Space Bar."

                                  co-op

Difficulty settings have not been implemented, however it is a difficult map.

This map was made with build and was made entirely from scratch.
