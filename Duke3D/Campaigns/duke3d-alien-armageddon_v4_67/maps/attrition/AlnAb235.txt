Misc. Author Info       : If it's not broken, find a way.
                          I still like to burn things.
			  It's not my fault if I'm better than
			  you, maybe you should spend some time
			  improving yourself, instead of getting
			  mad at me? :P

Description             : This level takes place from where
                          Nitroglycerin ended - the late ending.
                          Duke has been captured by the aliens
                          and is being held on a spaceship as it
			  limps back to their home planet.

                          There is no chance of turning the ship
                          around, because even if Duke could
                          figure out the controls, there is no
			  chance it would ever survive another
			  intergalactic journey or re-entry into
			  earth's relatively thick atmosphere.

                          Having long sailed by the furthest
			  man-made satellite, Duke is alone and
			  must find a way home. The only way out
			  is through, the aliens will not take
			  kindly to their uninvited guest, nor
			  the trail of damage to their property.

Additional Credits	: Forge, for testing the map.
