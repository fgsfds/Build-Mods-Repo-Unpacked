Description             : One of the biggest and most detailed city maps ever as a tribute to Pascal
                          Rouaud's amazing Roch series (if you're reading this Pascal - just like the
                          Jackson Five : we want you back !). Expect lots of action, secret places,
                          large urban areas to explore. At the end there are 2 possible endings:
                          you can take the easy way out or you can do it the hard way and fight one
                          last massive and insane battle. It's up to you.
                          Took over two years to build, so you'd better enjoy it, but we know you
                          will.
		         
                          The map exceeds the original limits, so it won't work without a port like
			  JonoF or Eduke. But we assume that by now everyone has those ports.  

Storyline               : Duke Nukem plans his vacation at Roch Island, a beautiful place somewhere in the
                          middle of the pacific ocean. After looking around, Duke decides to pay a 
                          visit to the Roch Island Library, to learn more about the history of this
                          place. Just as he's reading about Pascal Rouaud, aliens decide to disturb the
                          peace. Why? Well, Dukeburger has a new theme song, which gets played 24/7 all
                          across the galaxy. There's no way to escape that song, it's literally everywhere. 
                          And they hate it! Now they want to kill the man responsible
                          (Duke himself), oh and take over the world too while they're at
                          it. Time to kick ass and clean Roch Island from these nasty invaders!
                         
Additional Credits to   : Pascal Rouaud for the Roch series and all his innovations.

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch, and a lot of inspiration from Pascal Rouaud's Roch maps.
Build Time              : Two fucking years, on and off - mostly off. The map almost got abandoned
                          halfway through its making, we left it aside for like a year or so until two
                          months ago, then we started to work again on it and added a bunch of cool stuff
                          we thought up, we'd give each other a lot ideas, it was definitely fun. Hopefully
                          you'll enjoy this map as much as we enjoyed working on it.
Editor(s) used          : Build.
Known Bugs / Problems   : Nothing major, a couple of sprite glitches I guess, just like any over detailed
                          map with complex spritework, chances are that you won't even notice anything
                          wrong though.

* Important Information *

Installation           : 1) Install it.

Important Notes        : Again, this map looks best without hi-res textures, mostly becouse this map uses lots
                         of different pallette values. With hi-res turned on, it just looks UGLY. So please
                         TURN HI-RES OFF when you play this map.
                         Watch out for the secret places and the two endings, and basically
                         just have fun.
