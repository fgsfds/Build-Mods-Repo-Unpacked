Description		: E4L7 inspired city map. Atmosphere isn't as depressive as it
			  is on E4L7. Map is medium sized, linear, but it's should
			  be enjoyable to play. My style is comparable to 3D Realms'
			  maps, so expect some good ol' Duke visuals/action, with higher monster
			  density. This map was made back in 2009, and has been slightly edited
			  since (textures, shadows and other minor stuff). 
			  

Additional Credits to: 	3DR for Duke and the usual, and Mikko Sandt for feedback.
