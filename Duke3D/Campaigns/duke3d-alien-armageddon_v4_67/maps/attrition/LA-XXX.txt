Review by Kim Robinson on 25th November 2007

LA-XXX is a rather well designed city level with all the right stuff - realistic shadows, nice lighting, little to no oversizing and a terrific fun-factor. There's nothing quite like tackling half a dozen fat commanders in a church to get the adrenaline going. The level progresses very nicely and there's not much backtracking to do, so there's always new scenes of destruction to create and new waves of enemies to overcome. It all culminates in an enormous firefight in an alienesque area which is accessible from a portal in a graveyard - clichéd but done to perfection. At around 15-20 minutes gameplay and 150 odd enemies, it's more fun than you could poke a stick at. Cheers to Puritan for sending this one in.
