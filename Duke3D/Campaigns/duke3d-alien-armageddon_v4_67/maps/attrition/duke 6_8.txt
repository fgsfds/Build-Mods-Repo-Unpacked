This map was intended for play under 32 bit polymost only. HRP and 8 bit may cause sprite clipping visual glitches. Not tested with polymer. May work with Dukeplus and other mods.

Description           : EDF has sold Duke out to the aliens in order to save kidnapped top officials. Duke needs to get to the next town over
                        where there is a secret EDF bunker in order to exact his revenge if it's the last thing he does. But with vital EDF 
                        inside intel, the aliens have funneled him onto a dam with no way to escape. 
                        They finally have Duke cornered....or do they? 

			
			Duke 6:8
                        And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Duke, and Hell followed with him. And power was
                        given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with pistol, and with RPG, and with death, and with the
                        mighty boot.

* Construction *

Base                   : New level from scratch
Level Editor(s) Used   : Mapster32
Art Editor(s) Used     : None
Construction Time      : Seven to Eight month period.
Known Bugs/Problems    : PTSD, VW, underwater floor and stand-alone wall aligned sprites have odd behaviors when under water and want to act like
                         a bridge, so you may find a few spots where you can no longer swim, but the upside is you won't drown or use up your
                         scuba-gear. Also note that if you try to swim too low across some of those sprites, you may get "stuck" and lose the 
                         ability to swim forward/backward/left/right until you swim up away from them. Also note thatsome floor aligned sprites
                         used as roofs or window/door frams may have visual glitches and you may also be able to "climb" a few walls, but it 
                         doesn't give the player any advantage and doesn't affect game play, it's just the nature of the beast.The transparent
                         water has a visual bug if you look at it at just the right angle.

Important Notes        : Not intentionally made for use with mods, though it may work. If you use anything besides 32 bit polymost and it looks
                         crappier than normal; it's nobody's fault but your own.

You MAY NOT use this level as a base to build additional levels.  

You MAY distribute this map, provided you include this file with
no modifications.  You may distribute this file in any electronic
format as long as you include this file intact.

If you're desperate enough to steal from this map, then you're a sad, sad person.
