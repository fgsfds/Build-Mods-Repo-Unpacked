Description           : A CBP utilising Jonof port's new build limits to make
                        a bigger and more detailed map.

======================================================================

Part 01, Boss Arena | James Stanfield
=====================================
I built my part in just 2 days, and I think I managed to capture the feeling of the original episode 2 
quite well (barring the final boss fight, but at that point I just wanted to get the project done) 
As all CBPs go this one was fun to make however, and it was really entertaining to see that we've only 
barely just gone past the original limits due to the styling we used. I hope that there are plenty 
more JFCBPs where this one came from.


Part 02 | Sang
==============
I didn't really build all that much on this - as soon as you pass James' reactor core thing you're in my part.
I did come up with the actual 'design' of the areas but the most of it was edited by James to look shitloads 
better - not that I mind. I have the impression that my reception area grew out to be a "central hub" for 
the level, but whatever. Basically my part stretches out from that red forcefield to the other end of that 
lengthy room. Also, at that sloped walkway thing, the first room on the right is my work. The second room 
was something I built at first but it was edited quite heavily by James to a form in which it's no 
longer recognizable ;) My part isn't special by any means but at least it was nice to contribute to this CBP 
in some way.


Part 03 | Mikko Sandt
=====================
I borrowed some elements from E2L8 & E2L5 for my part. A curious detail is the forcefield surrounding all 
outdoor areas. We saw a similar element in E2L8. Luke and the Monolith also make an appearance. However, 
I'm not very pleased with what I've done. The whole part seems awfully cramped and insignificant. 
Standard E2 style mapping is not one of my strenghts.


Part 04 | MetHunter
===================
No comment from original author. I (James) improved little bits of Met's part along with the others and he was 
happy with the changes. Hopefully he'll return to the community someday since he's not a bad builder at all.


Part 05 | Steambull
===================
My part begins with falling into a small underwater area through the tube. I kind of like the water part, even 
though the water levels don't make sense with no possibility to make the doors auto-close. Well, I guess it's 
getting too much into it to think that anyone cares. The rest of my area is just random rooms that don't 
look that good and have a go-straight-and-kill gameplay. Luckily a lot of other authors made kickass 
parts and a little piss in the pool won't ruin anyone's day.


Part 06 | Telee
===============
My part was spread out and pretty small, but I'm happy with what I did. The main area dividing into my different 
rooms was the beginning little area to Sang's part. I'd also like to thank several other team members for improving 
upon some of my areas. It was great to take part in a CBP, if there's another one I might join in again, but 
that entirely depends on the theme; after building this I've learned that moon bases aren't my biggest specialty.
Whoever's reading this, I hope you enjoy the map.


Part 07 | Geoffrey van Dijk
===========================
Arguably the best segment of JFCBP2. Intelligent design, challenging gameplay and a fantastic atmosphere that's 
on par with today's next-generation FPS titles. The first thing I did when I got the map is connect some of the 
outdoor areas so my building is visible from alot of the windows throughout the map. Which is amazingly 
considerate of me, since it instantly increases the appeal of the other segments.

Part 08 | OrnaFulsamee
======================
My part was built in (This is a wild guess) 3 days. I kinda rushed it a bit, because I waited till the fifth to last minute,
thus, its a tad short and didn't turn out how I wanted it. But hey, I did something! I created a forcefield with a half rock 
half finished room, and made a combination to balance the flow of the map. I made a central intersection with one 
area leading to an armory, which had another combo lock, another led to the next persons part which was key locked, 
and another led to a meeting room where the key was.
