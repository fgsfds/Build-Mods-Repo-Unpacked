Description           : (SP Space Level) Ice moon. 
what does this map give me? 
over 300 enimys :) a few new sounds to go with the arctic ice moon theme. Erm and The origional 
Alienz Middi. didnt want to modefy the con files :P

What did I want to achieve?
I wanted to make a extream gameplay. I also wanted to create a 
harmonising peacefull atmasphare. Hopefully realistic although who knows what an Ice Moon looks
like :S 

Story.......
You have been buissy. First you recaptured the astro core mineing faciliy and then teleported 
onto the Alien mother ship to destroy there two super flying saucers... 
You found a alien stealth craft at then ending at steal your ride out. The earth forces are 
awaiting your return too cary out the destruction of the Alien Homeworld, But there is a
problem... Your stealth craft is only powerd as long as its in 200 light years from the Alien 
mothership. (So your mission is to go to the abandond Ice moon "Ravlon" where Earth forces were once 
mineing for glowing cristals capeable of grate power and find your way too the  Matrix transport
rocket)
This will take you the remaining 300 light years to the construction facility Where you will be 
given your next mission.>WGSpace4

about the "Moon"

This is "NOT"  our Moon!!
This moon was abandon 50 years ago because it was to close to the Alien homeworld so it was too unsafe.
since then the Alien scum have replaced the humans and have overpopulated the moon. 
Earth forces had been mineing on this Moon for 3 years eg... the houses igloos so on so on....
Yes its an Ice Moon Lots of water ice and snow...... Good lighting due to
its twin suns yet its far enouph away to not melt the ice ;)

remember this is all in the future ;) when we can space travel!!!!

I find my insperation.
