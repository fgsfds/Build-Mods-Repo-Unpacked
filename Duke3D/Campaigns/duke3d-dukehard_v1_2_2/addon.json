  "description": "https://www.moddb.com/mods/duke-hard\r\n\r\nInspired by the movie Die Hard, the episode consists of 17 levels by 15 different map designers and progresses from the lobby to the rooftop of a skyscraper. Each level is confined to its own floor of the building, and although each floor features a different theme, various design constraints ensure a certain degree of consistency throughout the episode."
