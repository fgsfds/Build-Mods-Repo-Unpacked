======================================================================


1) Installation / How to play :



    - Download and install the LATEST version of EDuke32*. 

    - Extract the content of the Duke Hard 7z into your EDuke32 folder. 
      This will create a new folder called "dukehard" in your EDuke32 folder. 

    - Copy-paste the file "DUKE3D.GRP"* of your copy of Duke Nukem 3D Atomic Edition into the root folder of EDuke32 (NOT in the "dukehard" folder).
      If you have the Steam or GOG version of Duke Nukem 3D installed on your computer, you don't need to do this. EDuke32 will automatically use the .grp file from those versions.

    - Launch EDuke32, and in the STARTUP WINDOW*** of EDuke32, under "CUSTOM GAME CONTENT DIRECTORY", choose "dukehard". 
      In that same startup window, make sure "Polymer" is unticked.

    - Press start and enjoy!


       ---If you are having trouble installing/running the episode, check the FAQ section for help---


    * You can download EDuke32 at http://www.eduke32.com/ or at http://dukeworld.duke4.net/eduke32/synthesis/
      Make sure you use the latest version.
      This episode requires version r5471 or newer.

   ** The file "DUKE3D.grp" is what contains of all the data of Duke Nukem 3D, it pretty much IS the game which is why it is required. 
      That file is also required to play the original game (or any other map, episode, mod, etc) in any sourceport.

  *** If the startup window doesn't show up when launching EDuke32, you'll have to re-enable it : in game -> options -> game setup -> "Show window at start: YES" (first line under game setup)


======================================================================


2) Important play information (MUST READ!)


    - This episode is intended as a VANILLA-like experience (as vanilla as EDuke32 can be), which means :

        * This episode is NOT compatible with the High-Resolution Pack. If you play with the HRP, you can expect half of the visuals rendering in a glitchy way. 

        * This episode is NOT compatible with gameplay mods. Play this episode with classic DN3D gameplay.

        * This episode is NOT compatible with Polymer. Make sure Polymer is turned off :
        (Make sure it is unticked at the top-right of the startup windows of EDuke32; or in the in-game options, choose a video mode that is NOT Polymer.)

 

    - You will lose all your weapons and items at the start of each map. 
      This decision was taken to ensure proper balance throughout the entire episode, as every map was built individually.
      Indeed, with a such long episode (17maps), the player would most likely end up with way too many weapons, ammo and items after just a few maps, if we didn't use this system.

      What does this mean for the player? 
          * Don't worry! We've provided enough weapons, ammo and health packs in each map ! (well, as long as you look around and don't rush like a madman)
          * You should use all the weapons at your disposal within each map, rather than 'saving it in case you need it more in later maps'
          * If you die and your last save is in a previous map, do not load that save. Press "N" and you'll start the current map over. You'll lose less progress.

   

    - The episode supports two difficulty settings : Let's Rock (skill#2: Normal) and Come Get Some (skill#3: Hard); which are the 2 difficulty settings 99% of players still use.
      A few maps (though not many) have also taken into account Piece Of Cake (skill#1) and Damn I'm Good (skill#4). 
      Only experienced Dukers should try Come Get Some on a first playthrough. Use Let's Rock otherwise.
      Damn I'm Good isn't recommended on a first playthrough, try it at your own risk!



    - To unlock the Randomizer mode (which let's you replay the episode with a different randomized map order each time you start it) and the Map Select screen ("Usermap"), 
      you need to beat the episode on Come Get Some without cheating.



    - This episode will NOT run in anything other than EDuke32 (DOS Duke, Jonof, xDuke, Rancidmeat, Megaton, etc). 
      Most levels can NOT work if played individually in anything other than EDuke32, either.

3) Misc Episode Information / Multiplayer / Map listing with mappers' comments 


    Misc. info :

        * MetHy started this episode, on the following idea : a community episode in which every mapper who wants to join gets to build one map (except MetHy Himself who gets several maps because he's like that). 
          It takes place in a building and each map represents a floor, the player has to go up the building, floor by floor, and each floor should have a different theme.
          Every map was built starting the same template (the staircase area + the unreachable place with the surrounding buildings). 
          This template was built by Cage.
          Except from MetHy, none of the mappers were able to see other mappers' maps.

        * Development of the episode started end of January 2014 and finished end of June 2014 (=5months)

        * Every map was built in a vanilla style. No new art, nor any new enemy/weapons/effects code was used. 

        * "Par" times and "best" times were provided by most mappers for their maps. You can see them on the stats screen after clearing a map.
          Try and see if you can beat the mappers' best times! 
          FYI "Par" & "Best" times of the map Flesh (dh11.map), as well as "Best" time of Executive (dh02.map), were provided by MetHy.

        * The intro and ending videos will look MUCH better in 32-bit video mode ("Polymost").
          Some maps were designed with 8-bit video mode ("Classic") in mind, while others were designed with 32-bit ("Polymost") in mind.
          However, everything was made to work and look fine in both modes. (for instance dh14.map "Legal Joint" looks better in 32bit)

        * Due to the intro and ending videos of this episode, EDuke32 will crash if it is not allocated 48MB of RAM for the cache (the cache is allocated automatically if it can).
          This is NOT an issue for computer users, unless you're using a very old computer in which case I don't even believe modern versions of EDuke32 will run smoothly anyway, even in 8bit.
          This means that this episode will not run on any non-computer version of EDuke32, such as the Wii version, unless you delete the .anm files.

        * FYI some maps actually run 'fine' in vanilla Duke3D, with some small visual quirks. 
          However, there are instances of effects used which only behave the way they were meant to in EDuke32, as well some small visual things which only look the way they should in EDuke32.
          Also, the secret map goes (slightly) over the old Building limit so it wouldn't run in vanilla and requires a sourceport.
          Even with that in mind, do not use anything other than EDuke32.

        * This is a FREE episode made by the community (NOT supported by 3Drealms) and meant to be played in EDuke32, as it is, without combining it with any other mod. 

        * You are NOT allowed to :
            - Upload anywhere any of the file individually, modified or not, without the consent of ALL the authors. 
              This includes Megaton's workshop (a lot of things would not look or work properly in Megaton unless we modify the files anyway).
            - Share this episode without all its files, including this readme file
            - Include this episode, or anything from it, in your gameplay mod, without the consent of ALL the authors. No, it is NOT fucking okay to do that, whatever you may think "PEOPLE" want.




    Multiplayer :

        Even if singleplayer was always the main focus, the entire episode was built with coop compatibility in mind.
        In the maps which by design could get coop players stuck, the authors have added coop-only elements to try and prevent the possibility of getting stuck, 
        as much as possible without hindering how the maps play in SP.

        The ONLY way to play the episode in coop the way it's really meant to be played is to WAIT until the EDuke32 netplay code is REPAIRED. 
        It is NOT recommended to extract the map files and play them individually in multiplayer in another sourceport. Half of the maps will not even work this way, and most others will look glitchy.
      
        Due to EDuke32 netplay code being broken at the moment, multiplayer was therefore NOT tested.
        If there are multiplayer-related things which need fixing, we will provide a multiplayer patch whenever EDuke32's netplay code is repaired.
        That patch would be available on the moddb page of the episode; if it ever exist.

        The following maps are DM compatible : 
            -Lobby, by MetHy : dh01.map
            -Showcase, by Paul B : dh13.map
            -Legal Joint, by Daedolon : dh14.map
            -Rooftop, by MetHy : dh16.map
            -Parking, by MetHy : dhsl.map

        Only Showcase (dh13.map) was actually tested in DM.





    Map listing with mappers' comments (if provided) :

     1. Lobby (dh01.map), by MetHy.
        Music : 233.778 Celsius - Lee Jackson (Duke Nukem 3D)

            Mapper's comment :
                I feel like this is my best map alongside the map Sex City I made for the Metropolitan Mayhem episode, hopefully you'll like it as well.
                There is a total of 6 small "jokes" in the Manager's Office! Though one of them (the "wanted" sign) is a joke only the active duke3D community will understand. 
                I'd like to thank anyone involved in the making of the episode for their hardwork, patience, and dedication, particularly Daedolon for his hard work near the end.
                I never thought this would turn out so big (and so good), and after 5 months of development, in the end the episode felt like a job to me at times. 
                I'm very glad we made it though and I'm proud of everyone's work. I hope you enjoy the episode as much as we enjoyed making it!


     2. Executive (dh02.map), By Steambull.
        Music : Nebel - Rammstein (Mutter)


     3. Construction Destruction (dh03.map), by Cage
        Music : Call Me - Blondie (American Gigolo)

            Mapper's comment : 
                This map was a struggle, but let's start from the beginning. For my map, I thought of a renovation/construction theme, depicted pretty realistically. To make it more interesting, 
                I thought to contrast construction with destruction - explosions and destroyable stuff. :) However, there wasn't much room for exploration in this theme, the way I envisioned it, 
                so you pretty much go through the whole floor to find a secret EDF command room and return back - the way back is a little different and repopulated with enemies. 
                You could call this pretty much a "scripted" level, and well, I've had a hard time making it work, since you can't really give conditions to touchplate triggers, 
                plus monsters never behaved the way I wanted them to! I've planned a lot of attacks from outside the actual building - most of the time those didn't work as I wanted, so I left only few. 
                Particularly disappointed with flying enemies behavior - instead of staying at player level and attacking or going inside the building, they tend to wander around, 
                flying towards the top or bottom of the outside area. I think it turned out OK in the end, but not as well as planned. I hope you'll enjoy it, at least the looks. :) 
                Also, guess this is my first released map, yay!"


     4. Bits (dh04.map), by Mikko Sandt
        Music : Warehaus - Lee Jackson (Duke Nukem 3D)


     5. Abstractech (dh05.map), by Michael "Micky C" Crisp
        Music : Basket Case - Green Day (Dookie)

            Mapper's comment : 
                Made this map in roughly 5 or 6 hours from scratch (possibly more; didn't count), including a lot of playtesting 
                and thinking "how the hell do I make this last longer than 30 seconds?". Decided a section with lots of moving
                parts would keep things fresh, and the map is very loosly inspired by my own section for CBP 8. Turned out better
                than expected so I'm quite proud of it. The midi is Basket Case by Green Day and I got it from Lunick.


     6. CEO Bathhouse (dh06.map), by James Stanfield 
        Music : Clotho - Tokuhiko Uwabo (Columns)

            Mapper's comment :
                My section of the tower is an executive sauna/bath-suite sort of thing, but I tried to use a set of textures that I don't see get used much (at least not together as the main theme) 
                it was inspired by the Palace of serpent resurrection (even though they don't resemble each other at all, go figure) Enjoy!


     7. Storage Wars (dh07.map), by Stumpy
        Music : Main in the Box - Alice in Chains (Facelift)

            Mapper's comment : 
                This is my first map in 10 years.. So be nice! I saw the Duke Hard posting in the Duke4 Forums and thought it would be a good little project to start building levels again.. 
                I wanted to make a darker level. This is the first map that I have ever published and I defiantly caught the mapping "bug". Thanks to Methy and company who put all this together! 
                Also a big thanks to the EDuke32 Dev's for keeping Duke alive!


     8. Eat The Rich (dh08.map), by Forge
        Music : Cars - Gary Numan (The Pleasure Principle)

            Mapper's comment : 
                MetHy started this CBP project and was actively looking for mappers to participate. Since he was desperate enough to mention me by name, I figured he really needed the help. Badly.
                So I made this penthouse styled apartment. I warned him that my already mediocre skills were incredibly rusty after taking a hiatus from making levels for almost two years. 
                If MetHy decides to include this thing with the final release, he can answer for it.
                Thanks to MetHy and Puritan for looking this over and helping point out the rust that needed to be knocked off.


     9. Commercial Break (dh09.map), by MRCK
        Music: Twin Peaks Theme - Angelo Badalamenti (Twin Peaks)

            Mapper's comment :
                My take on Cage's map happened to reveal itself as some kind of deserted mall floor with many amneties : a sushi corner, a balinese-styled café, a library corner and a furniture store. 
                I tried to compensate for a fairly uninspired theme with a solid, classic gameplay style, as well as a certain amount of eye-candy. 
                Your visit will be set to the Twin Peaks theme [angelo badalamenti].


    10. Cinematic Lounge (dh10.map), by Taivo
        Music : The Girl from Ipanema - Antônio Carlos Jobim

            Mapper's comment : 
                My map takes place in a cinema/lounge/videostore 


    11. Flesh (dh11.map), by Dukebot
        Music : Sign of Evil - Bobby Prince (Doom)


    12. Poormann's Library (dh12.map), by High Treason
        Music : The Other Library - High Treason

            Mapper's comment :
                The result of malfunctioning hardware and chronic depression, Poormann's Library is inspired by my dreams* and probably Japanese horror games. 
                It features a freaky dimension, otherworldly environments and its own soundtrack. It is intended to make the player feel a little disorientated.
                *For anyone that wondered, my dreams have always looked like a cross between a decaying industrial-scape and the otherworld from the first Silent Hill game - even good ones. 


    13. Showcase (dh13.map), by Paul B
        Music : Axel F - Harold Faltermeyer (Beverly Hills Cop)

            Mapper's comment :
                This map caters to Duke Death Match, Co-Op & Single player Modes. 
                This map has been tested with the Classic Renderer, Polymer, Polymost and Megaton renderers. 
                This map was never intended to be played with the HRP, while possible be warned the art gallery may look a bit more lively/broken with HRP enabled.
                There are 3 game play methods to playing this map: 
                1) Those who play like Rambo and enjoy the challenge by setting off motion sensors. (Also works well with CO-OP)
                2) Those that like to sneak around, by doing the level in reverse order, not killing a bunch of stuff, but doing the objective. (Getting to the next floor)
                3) Avoiding the motion sensors but still doing the objective in normal order.
                If this is your first time playing one of my Duke 3D user maps you're in luck! This is probably the best all around Duke 3D map i've made to date. 
                But do check out my earlier maps intended for EDuke with Polymer as the use of TROR and Polymer lights are present in those maps. Have fun!


    14. Legal Joint (dh14.map), by Daedolon
        Music : Pissed Office Box - Lee Jackson (Duke Nukem 3D)

            Mapper's comment : 
                Having a set, limited area to work with is almost completely opposite to my standard building style as I normally build a lot of winding pathways and
                never really focus on a single area this much, so I thought the CBP would be an interesting challenge.
                Still, I think I was able to nail down a solid level in terms of gameplay progression.

                Due to some effects I chose to create in the level, it's visually broken in the 8 bit mode due to how differently sprites are rendered.
                My philosophy with Duke3D levels is to build something interesting, even if it's limited to a certain renderer, or isn't visually perfect in any,
                rather than choose not to give any extra flair to your maps.

                Anyway, I think it ended up being a nice map for what it is, and should fit the episode quite nicely. Shoutouts to MetHy, Lunick and Cage for some test runs.
                I'm rather satisfied how the progression in the map turned out. I'm hoping you'll like it as well, thanks for playing!


    15. Power Out (dh15.map), by Mister Sinister
        Music : Goblin - Aigo Digital Laboratory (Liquidator)

            Mapper's comment : 
                Map takes place in administration office with lights out. This map is going to kick your ass. Was built in around 3 days (11hours)
                

    16. Rooftop (dh16.map), by MetHy
        Music : Departure - Lee Jackson (Duke Nukem 3D)

            Mapper's comment : 
                I was only supposed to make the first map and the secret map. I didn't plan, nor want, to make this map. 
                The mapper who was supposed to make the boss map was unheard of even after the deadline, so I had to come up with a boss map ASAP.
                I made the map in around 5-6 days, and in the end I'm glad I made it and I quite like it. 
                Thx to Daedolon & Steambull for their help on this map. Thx to Loke for giving me the idea of texture #3375 for the big teleporter.
                The rockets of the spaceship won't work if you play in anything other than EDuke32. Good thing this is an EDuke32-only episode!


    17. Parking (dhsl.map), by MetHy
        Music : Lemon Chill - Lee Jackson (Duke Nukem 3D)

            Mapper's comment : 
                This is the secret map of the episode. 
                If you don't find the map within the episode, you can 'unlock' access to it by beating the game on 'Come Get Some' -difficulty (without cheating).
                Since I'm the only one who got to make several maps, I thought it'd be a good idea to make other mappers participate to the secret map.
                Each of the following mappers made a car for the map : James Stanfield, Paul B, Forge, Micky C, MRCK, Stumpy, Daedolon, Taivo, Cage, High Treason (and myself).
                Daedolon also built the canoe.
                The sector based Pigtank is based on an example map made by the devs of EDuke32. I've slightly resized it, slightly changed its shape and textured it.
                The elevator is based on a design by Micky C. Elevator door made by Micky C (also used in map15 Power Out).

4) FAQ


    Q : The episode doesn't work, what do I do ?!
    A : Try reinstalling everything (see "Installation") in a new, clean, folder (which avoids conflincts with maps/mods you may have already installed). 

        Make sure your version of EDuke32 is up-to-date. The episode requires at least revision 5471 or newer to work.
        Download the latest version of EDuke32 here: http://dukeworld.duke4.net/eduke32/synthesis/

        Make sure your copy of the "DUKE3D.GRP" file is from Atomic Edition (v1.4 or 1.5; and not 1.3). If you have the GOG.com/Steam version, they are compatible.

        Rather than using the "Custom game content directory" command, an alernate way of installing the episode is to unzip dukehard.dat and dump all the files into your 
        root EDuke32 folder and simply run eduke32.exe. This is however not recommended, because it can create conflicts with other mods or maps you may have already 
        installed in the past or may install in the future. 
        Also in this case you'll need to delete all the Duke Hard files if you want to play regular Duke Nukem 3D again or another mod.

        If that still doesn't work, make sure the problem isn't something else (can you run the regular Duke Nukem 3D using EDuke32?);
        in which case I can't help you, but I'm sure folks on the http://forums.duke4.net/ -forums can.

        If you encounter an issue not covered in this readme, please contact us with your question on our ModDB page at http://www.moddb.com/mods/duke-hard/


    Q : Where can I get a copy of Duke Nukem 3D or that "DUKE3D.GRP" file you're talking about?
    A : You can buy Duke Nukem 3D on GOG or on Steam.
        You can get the "DUKE3D.GRP" -file from that old scratched CD of Duke Nukem 3D Atomic Edition you bought back in '96.
        Unless your mom got rid of it when you moved out for college (What am I saying ?! You still live in her basement).


    Q : I'm stuck in mapXX ! What do I do ?
    A : Keep trying ! Honestly, I don't think anything is harder to figure out than any of the things in the original game when playing it for the first time.
        ... still stuck? You can leave us a comment on the modd page http://www.moddb.com/mods/duke-hard/ or on the http://forums.duke4.net/ forums and we'll help you.
        Or, hmm, I mean... I'll help you. Maybe...

        Also I'm sure SOMEONE out there will make a LP of the episode on youtube at some point, so you can try to have a look at that.


    Q : This has nothing to do with Die Hard ! Where are the terrorists ?!
    A : First of all, there is no real 'terrorists' in the first Die Hard.
        Plus, if you want to go up a building floor by floor killing terrorists in a FPS, you should be playing Operation Body Count instead. 
        Or not, that game sucked.

        Seriously though, the episode shares a very loose connection to Die Hard, but there are a couple of references to it. That's it.
        It was never meant to be based on Die Hard (the idea of the title "Duke Hard" only came at the end of the development); but it's a common Duke Nukem trait to do mock-ups 
        of classic action movies, so we thought the name was a good idea. 
        (Group thinking is like group sex, sounds good on paper but you never know what that one guy is going to persuade the entire group of doing. No, seriously though, I like the name.)

    --- 1.1 (2014.07.08) ---

        - Changes to Credits (in-game, ending cutscene and readme)
            - James' last name added
            - Daedolon added to special thanks
            - Added "credits video composited by Daedolon" in the readme credits
            - Micky C removed from "special thanks" since it was put and left there due to a misunderstanding
        - Other changes in the readme file
            - Added Stumpy's "mapper comment"
            - Slighlty improved installation information
            - Slightly improved description of the difficulty settings (saying that skill 2 is normal and skill 3 is hard, and that only experienced Dukers should play skill 3 on a first play)
            - Moved the part about the randomizer and how to unlock it from "misc episode info" to "important info" (so people know they must not cheat to unlock it)
            - Removed the part in "multiplayer" telling people they "can (but shouldn't) play the map individually in multiplayer in another source port", since half of the maps don't work well (or at all) in other source ports, and since that may confuse people into thinking they can play the maps individually even in SP in other source ports or DOS Duke
            - Clearly stating the episode (and even most maps, individually) will not run in [every-sourceport-name+dosduke] (even though one should have been able to understand that with all the "EDuke32 only" everywhere)
            - Saying that the elevator doors used in the parking and in power out were done by Micky C
        - Changes to music
            - Fixed "nebel.mid" (of map02 "Executive") which was glitchy on some setups
            - Fixed "twinpeak.mid" (of map09 "Commercial Break") : no longer loops (by Hendricks266)
        - Map fixes
            - dh01.map "Lobby" :
                - Can no longer go and get stuck inside the fish tank
                - Can no longer stand on top of High Treason's name on his mailbox
                - Fixed the plug sprite of the printer, which had disappeared
                - Slightly moved the first Liztroop on the right so that he doesn't clip through the wall in 32bit video mode
                - Fixed the misaligned lamp texture of the 'downstairs' template area
            - dh02.map "Executive" :
                - Fixed the possibility of the crack leading to the yellow card not blowing up
                - Fixed (or at least, made it even less likely to happen) the possiblity of getting squished by the part in between the blown up wall and crate
                - Can no longer go into the fish tank
                - Moved button of the round rotating laser room so that one can not push it without going around (done by Steambull)
                - Changed par time from 9:30 to 8:30 
            - dh03.map "Construction Destruction" :
                - Fixed the possibility of getting squished when trying to go into a small electrical pannel
            - dh04.map "Bits" :
                - Fixed possibility of getting squished by the super computer before it's destroyed
                - Fixed possibility of the door not closing behind you when entering the super computer room (if you ran fast enough the touchplate wouldn't get activated;simply aimed the touchplate differently so that you don't have to WALK on the sector to activate it)
                - Fixed all the swing doors which would clip from certain angles (or at least, improved it very much, now may only clip for a split second when opening/closing)
                - Slightly moved those swing doors as well so that it's not possible anymore to shoot the enemies through the hole in between the doors and the wall (which used to be very tempting with that lonely closed-in pigcop)
            - dh05.map "Abstractech" (all fixes under Micky C's agreement) :
                - Changed map name from "Abstratech" to "Abstractech" (readme file + in-game)
                - Deleted a lonely useless untagged SE
                - Fixed sector warp due to the piston secret : Removed secret + put blockable outer wall to prevent crouch jumping into piston
                - Fixed the 3rd 2way train button which used to be really hard to use
                - Made the invisible blocking sprites around the circular rotating room with the screens 1-sided facing outward so the player can't get stuck between them.
                - Changed the use/placement of the buttons of that same room to how it was in an earlier version of the map : outside button opens/closes the door (with the door closed at the start) ; added a shootable button in the inside of the room which rotates the room
                - Due to this last changed; changed the coop only button from "controlling door" to "controlling room rotation" so coop players left behind can do both ; + put that same coop only button on the other side of the room as well
            - dh06.map "CEO Bathhouse" :
                - Fixed misaligned texture of the ceiling lamp (template starting area)
                - Fixed the misaligned lamp texture of the 'downstairs' template area 
            - dh07.map "Storage Wars" :
                - Fixed weaponless coop start (there was no hurtfloor)
                - Fixed the 'electricity-danger-symbol-sprite" in the last room (by Stumpy)
                - Added another small box next to that last room to hide the invisible-blocking wall (by Stumpy)
            - dh08.map "Eat The Rich" (fixes done by Forge) :
                - Fixed the jump to the vents in the freezer (which may or may not make the jump impossible in other duke3D ports/dosduke and in future eduke32 versions? Hard to tell though; i've run some tests and that same jump is sometimes possible; sometimes not; using the same port, weird shit but anyway may not be a problem anymore)
                - Fixed possibility of getting squished by a mirror
                - Fixed possibility of getting squished against a small part of the upperwall in one of the room
                - Fixed possibiilty of going on the unreachable balcony
            - dh10.map "Cinematic Lounge" :
                - Fixed weaponless coop start (some were on top of each others which may or may not result in friendly spawn deaths with friendly fire on?)
            - dh12.map "Poormann's Library" :
                - Fixed ceiling lamp of the template, which was 'cut' a little in a diagonal way
            - dh14.map "Legal Joint" (all fixes by Daedolon) :
                - Fixed the possibility of the player glitching through some windows (to prevent people from skipping major portions of the level).
                - Changed "C" in the ventilation shaft to "?" to prevent confusion.
                - Removed an alien egg that the player never got to see.
            - dhsl.map "Parking" :
                - Fixed the back of Micky C's car : deleted the remaining letters (sorry but i'm not having the text; the recommendation is in the readme though) + moved the plate up a bit + fixed texture getting misaligned between 8bit/32bit
                - Fixed Cage's car : some sprites on both sides of the car had disappeared by going 'into' the car
                - Fixed HT's car : the smoke was 'into' the car
                - Added a fast GSPeed to the 3 buttons of the power room to try and prevent the possibility of shooting them twice (for example with a chaingun)
