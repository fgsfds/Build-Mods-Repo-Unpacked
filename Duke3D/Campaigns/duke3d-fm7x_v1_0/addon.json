Duke Nukem, a hero in his own right, is well known and highly respected - the tough macho man the world needed to be safe from any threats the earth might face. Nowadays, the man himself has been resting without a single worry. Nothing could be more perfect than a good old tasty wine, a few cigarettes scattered on the living room table, and even some R\u0026R, which he never grows tired of.\r\nFast forward a few days later \u2013 a huge spectrum of colors sparks through the sky of the United States and a massive spaceship sweeps down to earth as fast as a flashlight, ripping apart a huge chunk of earth and trembling down the whole damn country.\r\n\u0022Really? They are back! But, how is that possible?\u0022, Duke shrugs while glancing at the wrecked streets near his place. It seems they will attempt another try to conquer our planet. But unlike the prior attempt, they account for Duke\u2019s interference, and they are well prepared this time (or at least they think so\u2026)\r\nSuddenly, but completely expected, Duke\u0027s telephone rings uncontrollably... \u0022Well, I guess it\u2019s time to do another favor to the world...\u0022, he mutters as he answers the phone, greets the Colonel and awaits new instructions."
