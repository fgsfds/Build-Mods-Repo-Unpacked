Other stuff     : DukeRoch, a Windows Duke3d launcher, which also allows you
                  to test all Duke3d sounds and musics, browse and test .GRP
                  files, and more...

Description     : My seventh map. The sixth in the series - Roch_sc1 will be
                  the 1st secret level in the episode I should make one day...

                  5 secret places.

                  If you love this map like I do and would like to know where
                  all secrets are, mail me to get a demo file that shows
                  everything (or to get my previous / future levels).
