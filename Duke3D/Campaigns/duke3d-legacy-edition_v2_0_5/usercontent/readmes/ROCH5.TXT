                  Please send me any comments about this map
                  If you post it on your web page, please tell me you've done
                  it so I can appreciate...

Misc.Author Info: I'm French (well, my English improves...)

Other Levels    : Roch, Roch2, Roch3, Roch_sc1, Roch4.

Other stuff     : DukeRoch, a Windows Duke3d launcher, which also allows you
                  to test all Duke3d sounds and musics, and more...

Description     : My sixth map. The fifth in the series (Roch_sc1 should be a
                  secret level) if I ever make the whole episode I wanted to
                  one day!

                  Some cool new effects. I especially like the second lift in
                  the map (guarded by a commander in the all white building):
                  its doors are synchronized to its moves.
                  Some other minor effects/tips & tricks.

                  6 secret places.

                  If you love this map like I do and would like to know all
                  secrets, mail me to get a demo file that shows everything
                  (or to get my previous / future levels).

Construction Time      : 3½ months (on and OFF)
Known Bugs/Problems    : VRPs sometimes get stuck in the map if you let them
                         turn around a long time without shooting them (their
                         route is quite complex and they can be deviated by 
                         other actors). I kept them though because I like them
                         (let's say some pigcops are a bit too drunk...)
