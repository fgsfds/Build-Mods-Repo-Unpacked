Misc. Author Info       : I have been making maps since the release of the game, pretty much.

                          This is a practice map of some sort that I started out of boredom last month on a laptop, that eventually grew into something playable,
                          and releasable. I had not touched Build / Mapster in months so it was a pleasure to get to toy around with that editor again, originally I only
                          wanted to build a few rooms to get the feel of mapping back but the level became fairly big real quick so I thought I would finish it.
                          I am fairly happy with how it turned out !

Released maps by me	: Metropolitan Mayhem episode, Happy Hangover / Anorak City / Bottles to the Ground trilogy, the AMC Pleaser, Roch Island, Filler, Overtime,
                          Rural Nightmare, the old Anarchy City series, and much much more, all available on MSDN (msdn.duke4.net), or scent-88.com.

Description             : A city block at night.

                          Local amenities include a swimming pool, apartments, a grocery store, a sewer system and more. Duke wakes up in his hotel room, finds out that the
                          city is under attack, yadda yadda, you think you know the deal, this time around you will have to figure out a way to get to that boss though...
                          It seems that cycloid emperors do learn about their past mistakes...

                          This is not my most detailed map by any means because I wanted to focus on the gameplay, layout and feel rather than on just throwing in massive
                          amounts of decoration and eye-candy. When you take the time to think about it some of those rooms are just plain empty and solely rely on the basic,
                          sector-based lighting / shading effects in order to look good, but do not let this put you off seeing as that basic style can actually work pretty
                          well ! This level is in fact very much in the vein of the maps I contributed to the Metropolitan Mayhem episode over the past few years, and I find
                          that it feels like some kind of original duke 3D level / lameduke map hybrid. Go ahead and try it out, and see by yourself !

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : A bit less than one month, was started out of boredom on my mother's laptop while I was visiting, I liked the results so I eventually emailed the map
                          to myself so I could keep working on it back home on my own computer. Then from there I started working on it on and off on different computers. Got
                          genuinely sucked into adding more and more stuff to it towards the end of the mapping process, which eventually led me to release it quite fast.
Editor(s) used          : Mapster32 (www.eduke32.com)
Known Bugs / Problems   : There is a secret elevator somewhere that will work on a loop as long as you stand on its platform, it really is no big deal and it has been made as
                          tolerable as it could have been without breaking the entire effect, but yeah, just thought I would point it out nonetheless.

                          Also, if you stand too far away from the boss its rockets won't reach you (not much of a problem though... chances are that you won't have the time
                          to notice without being taken care of already), and somewhere just before the swimming pool there is a glitch involving overlapping sectors that
                          might warp you from an upper floor to the floor below, most of the time you really have to want to make it happen though (ie. jumping / crouching
                          everywhere on a certain sector).

                          Also this is important : make sure not to waste your first jetpack, seeing as you will need it to reach a certain window near the start (as hinted to
                          on that first viewscreen in the first room). The map focuses on vertical exploration and action as much as it does on horizontal progression and
                          there are plenty of jetpacks to be used in the map anyway (as several secret rooms), so you will have the time to carelessly roam, fly and explore
                          around, just don't run out of fuel the only time you obviously need it.

Installation           : Install it. Duh !
Important Notes        : Actually this is not important at all, but this map happens to be released on the 16th anniversary of the map 'The Base' by Georg Buol, which was my
                         favorite user map when I was a kid, coincidentially. Yeah... This is an old game.
