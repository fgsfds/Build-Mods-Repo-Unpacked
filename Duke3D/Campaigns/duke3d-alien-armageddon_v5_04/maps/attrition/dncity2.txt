Description             : Take a look:
			  * It has all weapons and items
			  * a lot of traps and enemies
			  * the buildings have been constructed carefully
			    and are very nice
			  * if you are "in a hurry" there are a special
			    car and a lot of teleporters
			  * and you can be sure: you will not be
			    disapointed after playing this map...

			The story...

			After Duke killed every alien in the Duke Fan
			Club, disarm the bomb in that NASA's ship
			and clean the first part of the city, now he
			has a bigger trouble: those alien bastards
			have built a "Fort". 

	  Hint:

For dukematch:		Use the central buildings for war.
			It's for 2-8 players, but it works better
			with 3-4 or more.
