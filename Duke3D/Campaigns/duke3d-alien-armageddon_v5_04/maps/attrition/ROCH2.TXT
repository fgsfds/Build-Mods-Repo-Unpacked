                    PLEASE send me any comments about this map
                    If you plan to post it on your web page, tell me you'll do
                    it so I can appreciate...

Misc. Author Info : I'm French (so sorry for my English!)
                    I started making "wads" for Doom (and I DON'T like Quake!)

Other Levels      : Roch.map (1st level of a possible(?) "Roch" serie. It depends
                    on your encouraging e-mails!)

Description       : It's the continuation of Roch.map...
                    6 secret places to find, bumper cars to have fun, etc,...
                    To get 1st level ("Roch.map"), e-mail me and I will send
                    it to you.

Tips and tricks   : Please try to play this map without cheating for keys
                    or so. Ways and keys are not very hard to find!

                    To have fun: go and see bumper cars without killing monsters
                    in rolling cars. See their reaction. Sometimes, they are 
                    ejected, then get into the other car. I've seen four monsters
                    in the same car, one of them standing up on the hood! (really
                    funny!)

                    If you love this map like I do and would like to know all
                    secrets, e-mail me to get a demo file that shows everything.
                    Once again, feel free to e-mail me any comments.
