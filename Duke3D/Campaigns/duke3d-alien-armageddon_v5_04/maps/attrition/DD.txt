Misc. Author Info       : I'm just a regular gal working on Duke3d maps. 
I am on the SST_TC Team, and with the Warfare TC Team. (Both teams rock!)

Description             : Details: Duke is a regular cargo inspector, sent to orbiting space docks to check for illegal cargo.  As a routine check up on the dock station, Zero Alpha, finds Duke uninterested, a sudden distress signal comes up for only a second.  Duke grabs his pistol and locks and loads.

	While Duke finds a docking port, he notices another ship come to the station, figuring that it was a cargo ship, it was no threat to him.  Duke finds docking port 2, and readies himself of what might come.

I promise to god I'll never make another crappy map again.
(well, until the next time I don't care how the level ends)

Additional Credits to   : Bob, he helped me make the main corridor. My brother, for stealing most of my coffee.
