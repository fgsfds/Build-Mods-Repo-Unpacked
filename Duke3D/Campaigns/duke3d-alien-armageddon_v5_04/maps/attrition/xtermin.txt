Description           : A city map inspirated by Pascal Rouaud's Roch-
			series, Michael and Robert Caraballo's map
			"New York Plaza", original DN3D maps and many
			other maps.

			The story is very simple:
			You (Duke Nukem) are sleeping after very
			exhausting night.  Suddenly your flats bedroom
			wall explodes!  "Friggin' Aliens!!  Do you
			know how much it costs to repair that?!?", you
			shout.  "Get ready for extermination!!"
			So you take your trusted pistol from under
			your pillow screaming for revenge.  Time to
			clean the house (and a couple of other
			buildings) from those annoying pests!

			To make a long story short: Duke goes out to
			kick some ass!

			By the Way: if you get stuck, the answer won't
			be far away...  so keep looking around!
