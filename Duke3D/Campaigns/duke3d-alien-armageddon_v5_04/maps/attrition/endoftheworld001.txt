Title                    : The End of the World pt. 1

Date Started             : April 2011
Date Finished            : July 09th, 2015

Filename                 : endoftheworld001LEV1BRIGHTNESSintended.map  - original version of the map
                           endoftheworld001LEV1BRIGHTNESSintended.mid  - included MIDI background soundtrack
			   endoftheworld001LEV2BRIGHTNESSincreased.map - version of the map w/ slightly enhanced brightness in case you find
									 the other one too dark to navigate (the screen on the laptop I use
									 for Duke / Mapster being brighter than the average monitor)
                           endoftheworld001LEV2BRIGHTNESSincreased.mid - same MIDI file as the other one, just under a different file name so it
						 	  	         will still play automatically if you resort to playing the version of
									 the map w/ the enhanced brightness
			   endoftheworld001.txt                        - this .txt file

Description              : Yet another city at night - except this particular one is under a pretty fucking serious type of attack.
			   You wake up to an alien ship having just crashed right down your apartment building.
			   Out of your window, no scenery left in sight. What's left of the surrounding buildings appears to be collapsing
                           and dissolving into what looks like a sea of green slime. World takeover seems to have effectively begun.

			   Quite fortunately, your block seems to be magically protected by the vaillant presence of a convenience store
                           just down the street, still proudly adorned by a very circumstancial advertising slogan.
                           Salvation in capitalism and usually unhealthy commodities ?
			   Looks like all possible phantasms of procrastination are out of the window right now. Time to clean the mess.

Background		 : Map was started back in 2011 and is very loosely based on a neighborhood in San Francisco (actually the first building
                           is, as well as some elements of the BART station ; whereas other elements of the map happen to be mere nods to other
                           locations in England & Japan). After completing the first building and some of the surrounding exteriors, I started to
                           lose focus and give up on the map completion altogether, that is when I sent the map to scent-88.com reviewer-in-chief
                           Scott aka. "Forge" to reach for someone else's impressions and thus new inspiration. He suggested that since the map
                           seemed to have a rather vertical progression so far, I might as well keep following that general logic ; a simple
                           remark which was enough to prompt an approximate billion of new ideas in my head. I could already picture myself using
                           this start of a map as a basis to expand on never-before-seen locations such as complex cave systems digging deeper
                           and deeper through the structure of the planet and toward Earth's inner core, encountering underground villages from
                           ancient civilizations in the crust as well as gravity and magnetic field disruptance in deeper levels...

                           Unfortunately and as the map progressed (on and off and generally very slowly due to a lack of spare time), I quickly
                           realized it wasn't going to be feasible for me to put everything together as I had originally visualized it, partly
			   due to Build / Mapster limitations (the dreaded sector / wall / sprite limits), but also - and majorly - because of
			   my own shortage of free moments to devote to what would have been such an ambitious Duke map. I pretty much had to
                           come to terms with not being Zaxtor (probably the only active mapper / modder who could actually pull it off).

                           As a result, what you get is this rather plain (in comparison) level starting on the top floor of nearly-a-skyscraper,
			   going through oh-so-uncommon locations such as a market or a subway station, to finally get you nowhere in particular,
			   really. So, yeah, I fucked up a tad. Level ending is open to a possible sequel but I already know I really won't ever
                           get to create it myself. Still I just threw some of my original ideas out there, so now it's all up for grabs in case
                           anyone ever happens to be interested, or feel inspired.

                           Now, this map probably isn't that bad - it still took 4 years to make ; because it's not exactly as grand as I would
                           have loved it to be doesn't mean it's completely unambitious. I hope you'll enjoy it anyway.

Base                    : New level from scratch

Build Time              : 4 years (on and off).

Editor(s) Used          : Mapster32

Known Bugs / Problems   : Some visual glitches (sprites / masked walls clipping and the like), none of which affects the actual gameplay.

May Not Run With...     : I designed this level in (and for) Classic 8-Bit mode, although it probably looks just as good in 32-Bit mode.
                          Although, you really shouldn't play it with the HRP, due to how some colored palettes were used here and there,
                          which then might look off.

                          You should use Eduke32, as the original wall / sector / sprite limitations were clearly overpassed.
