Time to build           :  I spent so much time building this level I don't even
                           want to think about it.  I hit the limit on number of 
                           sectors so I had to back off.  Real weird things happen
                           when you try and exceed the maximum number of sectors.  
                           Too many stairs, doors, and the chess board in Duke's 
                           office.
