Thanks:
When I first created Bank Job, I wasn't sure if I'd ever finish my planned episode as I had no idea there was still such an active DN3D community. It's thanks to each of you that have downloaded and played my maps and the fantastic feedback you've given, that this finale is being released. Thanks for playing, really hope you enjoy the closing chapter!
