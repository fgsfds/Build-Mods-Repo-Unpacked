Description             :  After a hard night drinkin' Duke wakes up in the
                           basement of his office building.  Problem is the 
                           elevator is out of service.  Looks like he'll be
                           needing a jetpack.  I recommend a pentium for this
                           one.  

                           If you download Nukem Towers, rename it E1L1.map
                           and put it in the same directory, you will continue
                           on to that map (if you havn't played Nukem Towers 
                           you probably want to do this).
