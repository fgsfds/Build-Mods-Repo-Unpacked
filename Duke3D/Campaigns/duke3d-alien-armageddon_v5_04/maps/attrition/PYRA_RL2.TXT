Misc. Author Info       : I can't say that I'm an actual mapper per se.
                          While it's technically not the first user-map that
                          I worked on, I never got something that even tried
                          to be close in quality or contents to the various
                          official Duke Nukem 3D maps. Occasionally I thought
                          about the idea of making a "proper" map in the
                          last few years, if not earlier. This was a
                          really low priority, though. I guess that I
                          was eventually way more into topics like coding.
                          I finally started to work on this map after the
                          original release of the Ion Maiden preview campaign.
                          Again, though, this was still a low priority,
                          and I stopped after a small progress.
                          Later, I eventually decided that I want to get
                          back to it, and actually finish the work for good.
                          The map was released as PYRATEL.MAP
                          on April 1st 2019. Various improvements had been
                          finally implemented as of this July 2023 release.

Description             : If you're looking for any story, there's none, as
                          they don't matter as much as the gameplay, do they?
                          Also, I think that generally, most players either
                          don't read such stories at all, or do so just
                          since it's a kind of a habit for them.

                          Well, I guess that there's some alien invasion
                          in a kind of a populated oasis, and you have
                          to assist Duke with saving the night!

                          Otherwise, this map is partially inspired by a known
                          pyramid-shaped hotel in Las Vegas; Yeah, Luxor.

Additional Credits to   : - 3D Realms and the original developers of
                          Duke Nukem 3D, for bringing this game out. A few
                          of the original maps were occasionally referenced
                          while making this map, e.g., to see which tiles
                          were used in a few situations. Not for most
                          of the time of making this map, though.
                          - Ken Silverman, for developing the Build engine.
                          - Jim Dose, for working on the audio library.
                          - Mark Dochtermann, for coding the MACT library,
                          the SETUP program and the COMMIT code.
                          - Daedolon, for the exact details in implementing an
                          escalator (in this case a kind of diagonal elevator).
                          Note that as acknowledged by him beforehand, this
                          has its limitations; It is a hack, after all.

* Play Information *

Episode and Level #     : It's a user map, so I guess that E1L8
Single Player           : Yes
DukeMatch Level         : Yes
Difficulty Settings     : Yes

* Notes *

Compatible EXEs/ports   : Original DOS versions 1.3d and 1.5 (non-shareware).
                          It should theoretically be compatible with EDuke32,
                          but see "Known Bugs".

Compatible renderers    : Just the classic renderer. Other renderers,
                          like Polymost and Polymer, will probably work up to
                          some level, but Classic was generally the target.

Playing the map         : Usage instructions depend on which source port of
                          the game do you want to use, unless a DOS version
                          is preferred.
                          - If DOS version 1.3d or 1.5, you should first
                          extract the contents of PYRA_RL2.ZIP to the
                          corresponding directory. Exact details may change,
                          depending on the circumstances. Afterwards,
                          for DOS version 1.3d, use PY_RL2_3.BAT.
                          For v1.5: PY_RL2_5.BAT.
                          - For EDuke32, Rednukem, Raze or NetDuke32,
                          pass the ZIP file as a command-line argument.
                          Dragging-and-dropping the ZIP into the source port's
                          EXE file might also do the job. In either case,
                          select the map from the list of user maps afterwards.
                          - For other ports, your mileage may vary. To use
                          the intended music track, you might have to pass
                          at least one more command-line argument,
                          like -xPY_RL2_5.CON. Ignoring this, though, the map
                          was beatable with Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition
                          and Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour.

Usage with other data   : This map is generally *not* compatible with other
                          kinds of custom data. This includes, but isn't
                          limited to, any high resolution pack. Note that I did
                          make the map partially compatible with the HRP v5.4,
                          by rotating certain sprites, but that's it.
                          Other fixes may require the creation of
                          a maphack and/or some other work.

* Construction *

Base                    : Other than inspirations from original Duke Nukem 3D
                          levels, this is essentially a new level from scratch,
                          even if updated from the initial 2019 release.
                          There's also the bundled file of PYRA_RL2.MID, which
                          is simply a renamed extracted lordofla.mid track.
                          Basically, this is Bobby Prince's "Lord of L.A."
                          track, which can be heard in E3L8, i.e., Hotel Hell.
                          It is bundled with this map as described above,
                          so it can be used with source ports that pick it.

Changes from release 1  : There are too many to list. More detail are
                          in the git repository as of writing this:
                          https://gitlab.com/NY00123/pyratel/
                          Following are some highlights:
                          - Changed shadings of most walls to follow
                          Doom-style "fake constrasts", initially
                          via M32 scripting.
                          - The pyramid-shaped hotel isn't surrounded by
                          invisible blocking walls anymore.
                          - Similarly, the air hockey pieces shouldn't
                          block you.
                          - A few more enemies were added before level exit.
                          How many are present depends on selected skill.
                          - Miscellaneous resizings of objects.
                          - Small compatibility improvements
                          for Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition and
                          Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour.
                          - Fixed Dukematch-exclusive crack tagging.
                          - A jetpack is now accessible in Dukematches.
                          - Made various changes in order to try and reduce
                          the chances of reproducing unintentional warps while
                          using Vanilla Duke3D or impacted source ports.
                          - Brought back a steroids pickup originally present
                          before the map's initial release. Warps are still a
                          possibility, but so can be clipping into void space.

Known Bugs              : - When you reach that riddle of sorts
                          (with the shrink ray) after going through the
                          sewer, it's possible that you will simply not
                          be able to unlock the way out in the usual means.
                          It is confirmed that this riddle is compatible
                          with DOS versions 1.3d and 1.5, as well as
                          EDuke32 r10322-77e6bb66f. On the other hand,
                          your mileage may vary with any other EXE,
                          including modern source ports of Duke Nukem 3D and
                          other specific (probably older) revisions of EDuke32.
                          - It's possible that you'll unexpectedly find
                          yourself in a totally different location. If you
                          ever heard of the so-called "warping" glitch, this
                          is it. I originally tried to take care of this by
                          making a few sectors somewhat wider/larger, and as of
                          release 2, also by renumbering sectors as present in
                          the map file, but your mileage may still vary.
                          - I did leave a few relatively thin door sectors,
                          which can theoretically be used for warping if you
                          try to go through them. But this can also cause
                          other unrelated issues, the most commonly
                          known one probably being Duke's own death.
                          - Monsters may also warp in a similar manner.
                          - After using the red access card, you may have some
                          troubles with controlling the "escalator" that
                          follows. I'm not sure why I originally called it an
                          "escalator". Either way, this is expected, since it
                          is really a hack, albeit it's one which I thought
                          about back when the idea for the map was originally
                          in my mind, more-or-less.
                          Even Daedolon, the guy who came up with the chosen
                          implementation for this map years before I started
                          working on that same map, acknowledged the known
                          limitations. You can simply break the glass on
                          the sides and ignore the "escalator", although it's
                          recommended that you have protective boots for Duke.
                          Oh yeah, save the game, too!
