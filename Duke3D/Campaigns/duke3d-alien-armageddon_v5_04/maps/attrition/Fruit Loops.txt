Description           : Duke is about to enjoy a nice meal of Fruit Loops in his apartment.
			All of a sudden, the phone rings, and Duke has to delay his meal.
			" Yeah, what ?! "
			" Duke ? This is EDF command. Code Mad Eagel !! "
			The other end hangs up, and Duke stands there, wondering what the hell
			" Code Mad Eagel " means.
			" I should probably know this....
			  Nah, what the hell, I`ll just call EDF and ask. "

			" Earth Defence Forces, Been saving your ass since 1947, may we help you ? "
			" Yeah, this is Duke Nukem, alien ass kicker, been saving YOUR ass since 1996.
			  I think you guys need my help. "
			" Hold on, and I`ll get one of the executives on the line. "

			" Hello ? This is Field Commander Johnson speaking. Duke, is that you ? "
			" Yeah, it`s me. Listen, one of your men just called me. He used the code "Mad Eagel".
			  What`s that all about ? "
			" Hmmm, wait, I got it. It means that an alien invading force
			  has captured a goverment-owned building. "
			" And I`m supposed to take it back ? "
			" That`s the general idea, yeah. "
			" The goverment owns thousands of buildings. How am I supposed to know which one
			  has been captured ? "
			" Oh yeah. That could be a problem. Wait one sec, and I`ll get you the address. "
			
			The Field Commander leaves the phone for a minute.

			" Dry Desert Mesa, Texas. It`s the only building in the area. "
			" Will I have time to finish my meal before leaving ? "
			" Uh, no. The aliens are really mad and all. I think you should get there ASAP."
			
			Duke hangs up, pissed off about his Fruit Loops meal being delayed by
			a small invasion.
			While slapping a clip into his gun, he says :

			" Damn, someone`s gonna friggin pay for screwing up my Fruit Loops !! "

		
			* 2 HOURS LATER, SOMEWHERE IN TEXAS *

			" Sheesh, didn`t know there were so many mesas here. "
			Duke comes out of a old mining-entrance, after having checked out
			ninety mesas with no luck.
			All of a sudden, he sees a old, grey brick building up ahead.
			" Hah, finally. All I have to do is to cross this canyon. Shouldn`t be a problem..."

			He takes a few steps onto the old wooden bridge connecting the two mesas.
			It creeks under Duke`s weight.

			Halfway onto the bridge, Duke hears something he`s not quite happy about.
			Behind him, the planks he earlier stepped on starts giving away, and falls into
			the abyss.

			Keeping his head cool, Duke hauls ass over to the other side,
			before the whole bridge disappears.

			Before him lays the building he has come here for.
			

Hint		       : First attach the C-4 to the door before giving the electric signal through
			 the wires.

			 Duck and press Space to activate the C-4 firing mechanism.
