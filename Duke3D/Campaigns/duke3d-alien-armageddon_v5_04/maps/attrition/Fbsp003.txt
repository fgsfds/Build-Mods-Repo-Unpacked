                        ( Dutch, but not too hard to navigate )

Description	      : A part of the alien invasion army has invaded
                        and fortified a city that, once completely
                        taken over, will give the aliens a great
                        benefit because of it's strategic position.
                        You are to enter through the old subway system
                        and clear as much ground as possible to make
                        way for EDF's troops.
			
Other Levels          : can be found on my site.

Additional Credits To : Everyone in the community that had an overall
                        positive influence on my maps;
                        James, Jesse, Maarten Pinxten, Alejandro,
                        C3P0, William Gee, Mikko and Bob Averill.
                        Another big thanks to Mikko for giving me
                        some ideas that made this map extra-awesome.
                        Some credit goes to Red Alert 2 as well, for
                        the idea of placing sandbags around buildings
                        and such.

                        Finally, I'd like to apologize to Cody for my
                        irrational behavior a few years back, and I'd
                        like to wish you the best of luck on current
                        and future projects.

* Skybox *

I've included a custom skybox in this zip. It's optional, the map
looks just as good with hitile textures than it does without it.
Ofcourse, this skybox can only be used with Jonofs port; browse the
3drealms forums to find it. ( www.3drealms.com )
I've found this skybox at www.levels4you.com.
