Description (story)   : M&Y Corporation is an enterprise that
                        illegaly sells weapons and military equipment
                        to another countries. They earn a very high
                        amount of money with this business and they
                        don't think that a possible war is coming...

                        Monday, 7:32 am, Duke was sleeping when he
                        receives a call from the EDF in his phone.
                        -"Duke, we have a new mission for you...
                          please report immediately to the EDF
                          headquarters".

                        Duke goes there and then he is informed
                        about the mission. The Gral. Heisafuck shows
                        him a computer screen which is showing an
                        eyewitness report telling them about what
                        is happening in that hidden enterprise.

                        Duke doesn't wait one second, gets his
                        pistol, his chaingun and his car, and he goes
                        immediately to the M&Y headquarters. After
                        getting there, he discovers that the things
                        are even worse than he imagined: They are not
                        selling weapons only to other countries. Duke
                        finds aliens  working here and there and then
                        he understands that they wanted all these
                        hi-tech missiles that the company is selling,
                        so he only has to destroy the missile
                        assembling facility and all the stuff existing
                        there... and he's not allowed to fail because
                        if he does, we don't know the future of our
                        planet...

                        Then Duke receives a message from the EDF in
                        his pager: "Duke, we have an airstrike
                        prepared to destroy the place, but first you
                        have to clear the plant, because if there are
                        still aliens in that place, ther would be
                        able to activate their defense systems. So
                        you'll have to complete this mission alone,
                        we can't send more help. Kill all the aliens
                        and when you exit we'll destroy it all."

                        (By the way make sure you read all the screens
                        in the map to follow the story!)

                        Thanks to all these guys for comments and
                        suggestions, however I didn't do all because
                        I've reached the Build limits.

                        (however with small limits).

                         the dukematch in the garage part.
Cooperative 2-8 Player : Too hard for you? (I mean NO)

=====================================================================

* Construction *

Base                   : New level from a ugly empty grid
Level Editor(s) Used   : Mapster
Art Editor(s) Used     : None
Construction Time      : 1867 hours, 27 mins and 40.3 secs
                         Umm... nah, really it took me 1 month.
Known Bugs             : Looks like this map is too complex :) so
                         framerate should be low and this map won't
                         run in slow PCs. Also in one scene there
                         is a temperature switch which causes a big
                         explosion with some alien bodies near it.
                         Due to the jibs, glass pieces and explosions
                         in that scene there are about 4000 sprites
                         in the map and that should slow down most
                         of the PCs, or even the game may look
                         "crashed" (but anyway you hear the explosion
                         sounds, so it's not really crashed, just
                         wait to the end of this effect). Then I
                         have a recommendation for you in that part:
                         When you activate the temperature switch,
                         stay far from the door, otherwise you could
                         die in the explosion.
                         
                         And yes there is one "problem" in this
                         map: When you start Dukematch and player
                         1 has to hit the big switch, if you're
                         running while you hit the switch you may
                         be trapped in the puzzle area with no
                         exit. I'm not going to correct this,
                         because if you do that, it'll be worse
                         for you :)

*Important Information*

Installation           : Copy all the files to your Duke3d directory,
                         open the DOS prompt and type:

                         "duke3d map mm"

Important Notes        : Originally this map was much better, but I
                         had to remove a lot of details and stuff
                         thanks to the Build limits :(

                         Also this is my last Duke3d map, until I
                         release a new one (duh).
