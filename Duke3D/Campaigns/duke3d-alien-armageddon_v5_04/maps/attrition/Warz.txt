Description : Duke has been shot down from the air again. He landed 
in the centre of a warzone. Enemies are around him everywhere. Your 
task is to make Duke escape, but it will not be very easy. I promise 
you a wartime atmosphere, destroyed buildings, damaged vehicles and 
tons of enemies everywhere. Unfortunately my design crashed the 
framerate, so if you have a slower machine than a P100 with 16MB RAM
be prepared to set back the game resolution from SVGA. Try to use 
SMARTDRIVE to incrase speed. The map was originally designed for a 
Duke TC group, Banzai Productions's project: Critical Mass, but it 
didn't fit, because of the framerate. If you would like to know more 
about this project here is its address: http://www.dmzgames.com/banzai 
But you can find a link there on my homepage too.
