    Date Finished           : February 2014
     
    Filename                : BCBP.map
     
    Authors                 : In rough appearance of section (not order of construction):
                              Undertaker (upto gate)
                              Michael "Micky C" Crisp (up to and including subway section)
                              Captain Awesome (small underground cave connection)
                              Supertanker (Underground area and small beach city section)
                              Mike Norvak (Basic dam design, details added by others)
                             
                              Other mappers who didn't quite make it:
                              Drek (axed when trying to fit CBP into one map)
                              High Treason (his section was incorporated into Quantum Physics)
                              Maarten v. Oostrum (may release his section as a seperate map)
                              quakis (does what quakis does best)
                              Henri K. (disappeared half way through. Will probably release his map seperately if he ever comes back).

    Email Address           : Just look for/make a thread at Comg Get Some Duke Forums (http://www.scent-88.com/forum/index.php)
                              Or Duke4.net Forums: (http://forums.duke4.net/)
     
     
    Description             : Those alien scum have once again ruined Duke's vacation, and it's up to him to fight his way across the beach-covered
			     bay towards the dam to (sigh) deactivate the portal that they're using to transport to Earth. The map is more original
			     than the plot.

                            Micky C
                            I guess I'm the one who started this project. There was a screenshot at Duke4.net of a beach which inspired some
                            discussion between several mappers. I decided to take advantage of this interest and start a CBP out of it. In order
                            to get more done faster, I made it so there was an extended wall limit, which theoretically resulted in more maps and
                            that everyone would make their section at the same time to get the CBP done faster, with the sections to be combined
                            afterwards.
                            Biggest mistake ever.
                            The extended limits meant bigger sections which took longer to do, which was probably one of the reasons why so many
                            people never finished their section (even though it still wasn't that big..). And everyone doing their sections at the
                            same time led to incredible inconsistency in style. High Treason did a dark, stormy beach, Drek did a foggy, cliff-like
                            thing. Even though the different maps were meant to accodomate different style, it was still too much. My section was
                            first, and then Undertaker built on front. Those two sections at least were how I imagined the CBP to be at the start-
                            sunny, beach-front gameplay. Finally I combined Supertanker's section with mine and Undertaker's and I think the resulting
                            map ended up pretty good!

                            This was my first bigger CPB that I took part in. I really enjoyed working on it,
                            and later on polishing the thing. It was such a shame that so many people didn't finish their job,
                            as it could morph into something bigger. Still I'm really happy with it.
                            Enjoy, and try to catch every gag i placed around ;)

    * Construction *
     
    Base                    : New level from scratch.
    Build Time              : 1 year. It was originally several people working on 3 maps at the same time for a small episode, but when most of the
                              team randomly vanished after the first month or two, the project stalled for about 9 months. Not too long ago I (Micky C)
                              decided to take the best and most consistent sections and combine them into a single big map, which is what you see now.
                              Myself and Undertaker then did some general polishing.
    Editor(s) used          : Mapster32
    Known Bugs / Problems   : 1. Some of the walls in the corridor near the start where the lights go out don't change shade properly.
			      2. Due to the pal we're using to get the beach sand the colour we want, some colours on sprites won't show properly on sand.
			         E.g blood will look brown, and we're unable to use alternate pals on sprites since they're overridden by the floor pal.
     
     
    May Not Run With...     : Classic and polymer. In classic there are some sprite clipping problems and texture warping.
                              In polymer due to the map's large size, the framerate is horrible, and the draw distance cuts half the map out, which is
                              is very ugly. In the future these problems might not be an issue.
