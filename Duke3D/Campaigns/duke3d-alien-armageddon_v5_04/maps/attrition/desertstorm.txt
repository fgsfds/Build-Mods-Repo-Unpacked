Description             : After 11 long and frustrating months, with random curses thrown at the monitor and Mapster32 crashing with no apparent fucking reason, the map is finally finished, hope you enjoy. A large level set in a canyon somewhere in the US. Duke has to infiltrate a command center, which is now under alien control, and kill the two overlords responsible for the takeover - the Bruiser Brothers.

It was originally supposed to be even bigger and more ambitious but sadly due to engine limitations it never reached its full potential.

Additional Credits      : David Shire for the soundtrack of "2010: The Year We Make Contact"

Known Bugs              : It's possible to glitch through the beams in storage area 02 - once you're in you can't get out however, unless you noclip. Also, in the control room looking over storage area 02, the view screen is a bit buggy; you need to stand right in the center of it and look on either sides of the screen and press your use key.
May Not Run With...     : Old DOS version of Duke Nukem 3D or JFDuke32.

Important Notes         : WILL NOT WORK WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN EDUKE32! Since the wall limits have broken well over their original numbers it will not work with the DOS version; trying to get it to work will only result in a major headache on your side, so don't try it. There have also been reports of computers having severe meltdowns including the monitor exploding right in the face of the user thus killing them.

Installation            : Unzip the contents of the .ZIP into the root folder of EDuke32. Launch the .BAT file to play.
