title		: Another Attack (Part 1): Woudrichem War
Filename	: AAP1Woudrichem.map
Author		: Maarten van Oostrum
E-mail adress	: maartenvanoostrum@gmail.com (oostrum_maarten@hotmail.com is also still a option).
Misc.Author Info: A busy guy with busy live has still time for making a new Duke Map!
		  
                  		 
Release Date	: 15-07-2020 (my birthday to be exact! 
		  Yes, since 'Spacetronic'  I'm releasing maps on my Birthday it seems.. :P)
		 
Other levels	: Maa2 (my first map back in 2001...like..uhh..WHUT DUDE!?)
		  MaaDM2 (MAADM was never released).
		  Maads (Maarten Desert)
		  Toxicity
		  MaaDM: Temple of Death
		  Alien Planet X64-2
		  Another Big Base Attacked
		  The Unknown Planet
		  Spacetronic
		  !dm-maa (for dukeweb contest, wasn't really a map and probably lost).
		  And many un-finished and old crap maps which never got released or even got lost.. :-(

		  Projects with other people, where I took a part in:
 		  OGBB (made with William and Merlijn)
		  Supa3 (with Sangluss and Merlijn).
		  CBP2, CBP4 and CBP5 (made with the community :P)
		  Clear The Coast
	   	  The Imperium Episode
		  Roch Island
		  And probably much that I forgot about...
  		 		 			 
Web page	: No Duke related site. Just Facebook & band pages.

Future levels	: Not going to make any promise, but..right now I DO have many ideas for sequel(s) :-)
		  It all depends on inspiration / live stuff.
		 
Description 	: This time I actually made a city based on a real life town: Woudrichem.
		  A place @ The Netherlands that I love since I visited it a few times.
		  

Files included	: AAP1Woudrichem.map, AAP1WoudrichemWar.txt, AAP1Woudrichem.ogg
		 
		  
Mission/plot	: In short: you have 3 ways to make your way.
		  Each way has one keycard.
		  Also, when using the 3 keycards...there is a climax! Surprise surprise..
	
		  The map also contains viewscreens to help your way out. So be sure to use them!!

* Construction *

Base		     : Ur mother.
Level editor(s) used : Mapster32
Art Editor(s) Used   : Studio One...Music is art, right?
Construction time    : About 7 months - very fast for me :-O
Known bugs/problems  : This map DOESN'T WORK WELL ON OLDER SYSTEMS OR EDUKE! (9+ years)
		       ...since the map is very HUGE ;-)
For the tech-nerds:
Music recording	     : Studio One. All written, performed and recorded by me.
		       Also remasterd by Tim Jansen
	      
* Were to get this MAP file *

File location	     : Duke told me you can find this level on the Alien PLanet X64-2, it belongs there.
		       If you can't find it, maybe you should try sites like:
		       scent-88, MSDN, Duke4net (and I guess more).

How to start this map: Unzip all the stuff in your Duke folder, start the game with eduke32, 
		       go to episode selection, select "user map" and select "AAP1Woudrichem.map". Done!

* Important information *

I don't care what you do with the map :) BUT!...
Don't steal anything without giving credits, don't use this map as base for your own map,
don't spread this map under another name, DON'T release this map with changing the text file/map.
so let the zip file stay as it is.
Otherwise... I have to send my rabbit to you that will find you...and kill you. Trust me, you don't want that
to happen, don't you? ;-)


HAVE FUN!!!!!
