\-------/
Duke Nukem, who is a veteran agent of EDF, had a very hard work
the last 6 years. And now it was time for vacation :)

Duke was on the coast of California for 3 months enjoying that
he finally got some free time, and then, he returned to the EDF
Headquarters to bring his help again.

Gral. Heisafuck: Good day Nukem, I hope that you enjoyed your
                 vacations.
Duke           : Yes General, was too good for me! Anyway,
                 now I'm ready for more action.
Gral. Heisafuck: And that is what I was thinking. But these three
                 months were surprisingly calm. We had almost
                 no problems, only a few things but nothing important.
Duke           : Well looks like these Alien bastards were waiting
                 for me, heh.

Meanwhile, there seems to be a message in the queue of the Gral.
Heisafuck's PC, that came from the EDF's secret network... Duke
didn't doubt one second and went immediately to the computer to
read that...

/* Gral. Heisafuck, please report here at our base #45, we have
   some news for you... */

Gral. Heisafuck: Well Duke, I'm going to see what happens...
Duke           : Ok, bye...

And duke returned to his house to sleep one more day... At the
morning, the Gral. Heisafuck called duke: "Duke, it's urgent,
please report here as soon as you can". Duke went immediately
to his red Ferrari and moved to EDF HQ.

Duke           : Here I am, what happens?
Gral. Heisafuck: We have problems at Hydroponics Sub Station,
                 a facility that we have installed in the south
                 of Argentina. Aliens have taken that place which
                 is also used to distribute water to many cities,
                 and looks like they are distributing viruses
                 through the water pump system. We don't have very
                 detailed information about these viruses but they
                 have reported 1500 dead people, and only for now...
                 so you must destroy that facility.
Duke           : So there is no time to waste... No problem, but
                 how am I supposed to do that?
Gral. Heisafuck: There is a chamber with an emergency override
                 switch, if you press that switch the pressure will
                 get higher, all will become inestable and you will
                 have some minutes to get out of there.
Duke           : Ok, I'm going in...
