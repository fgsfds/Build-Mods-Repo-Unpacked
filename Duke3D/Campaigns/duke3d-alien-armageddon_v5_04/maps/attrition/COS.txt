*Important Information*

Installation      : Just unzip cos.map to your Duke3d directory. If you're starting from the DOS prompt, just type
		    "duke3d map cos"
 
Important Notes   : This map uses the undocumented SE26 effector (escalators). As far as I know, this has never been
		    done in a Duke Nukem map before (Except in LameDuke). I've sent a tutorial on this off
		    to Dukeworld, but if you can't wait for the next MapFaq revision, e-mail me and I will send 
		    the tutorial to you. :)
