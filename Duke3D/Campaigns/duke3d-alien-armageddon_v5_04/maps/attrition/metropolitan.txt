Release Date          : 2nd of March 2012

Description           : Around January 2010 MetHy came up with the idea of making an episode 
			                  in the style of the original Duke Nukem 3D city maps (episode 1, 3 & 4).
			                  Later on MRCK became project leader. The idea was to restrict ourselves: 
			                  each map should be made in only 24 hours, including time not spent
			                  on building. While the basis of most maps respected this restriction, we 
			                  also decided to take a bit more time to polish things, to end up with 
			                  better results. We also decided to include Meatball Sub Makin', a previously 
			                  released standalone map by MRCK, because its style fits perfectly with the 
			                  rest.	
                        The result is a total of 15 maps (including 1 secret map and 4 boss maps)
                        respecting the style and feel of the original city maps.

* Author Notes *


Aymeric "MRCK" Nocus:
For this project, MetHy contacted me a while back (think two or three years ago) about an idea that he had - let's
recontextualise everything first, and say that back then, the duke nukem 3d mapping community was going through odd 
times, with a severe lack of new releases (ironically enough, much in the vein of what is happening again nowadays), 
and a somewhat lost sense of the aesthetics of the original game, people (both on the mapping and playing fields) 
were now crazy about releasing maps that broke the old sector and wall limits of the build engine, using new features, 
mod-based gimmicks or even a certain (some will say modern) sprite- and palette-based graphical style that no longer 
resembled the aesthetics of the original levels we had grown up playing at all. So methy's idea was about releasing 
an entire episode of old-school-styled maps, with the funny restriction that no map should take more than one single 
day to make (even though building old-school looking levels can take just as much time as, if not more than building 
in the modern style), so that its release would hit the community real quick by surprise. It started out very well, 
we contacted several other mappers such as merlijn and mikko and we all pumped out quite a few good maps in a really 
short amount of time, then everyone naturally started slacking on their respective ends and the progress slowed down 
for a while. I made seven maps for this then life got in the way, so after some time spent in vain waiting for an 
occasion to polish the entire project by myself for good before a potential, definite release, i gave up and sent all 
the maps back to Mikko and MetHy for the finishing touches. Now here we are, two or three years later, releasing a 
project that was originally supposed to barely take a week, with a bunch of maps all entirely made in less than twenty 
four hours (with a few exceptions... nobody is perfect). It was a really fun one to work on, probably my last contribution 
to the community too (in a good while at least) and i hope you enjoy my work !

I made the following maps: Croque Monsieur is the second map of the bunch, built in just one afternoon straight after 
MetHy's first beta of the first map. It borrows some inspiration from E1L1 and E1L2 as well as some more modern maps, 
and user maps that were released back in 1996 or so that influenced my mapping style and tastes when i was a young mapper. 
Meatball Sub Makin' and Derailing follow the same kind of architectural style and borrow from the same influences, with 
some direct rabid transit influences for the first one and a bigger focus on the look of E3 maps in general, i tried my 
best to make everything look coherent, connected from place to place and give players as much freedom of movement as they 
had in the original game, with a lot of rooftop fights and other cool shit! Both took a little longer than a day to make, 
Meatball took three days, whereas derailing took two days with a several weeks-long break in between. I also made two of 
the four boss maps (one entirely made from scratch as a tribute to stadium, very loosely based on the blueprints of a 
real-life stadium i used to live close to when i was a kid ; the other one mainly consists in copy-pasted bits of several 
of my own previous levels, originally released independently over the past ten years, linked together by the means of 
abstract, rather psychedelic transitions). I also made Train in Veins, the train map at the end of the episode, that was 
ultimately taken over by MetHy who eventually fixed the gameplay and added a roof to the train while adding the finishing 
touches to the episode ; and finally, the secret skatepark map (built in one day too) Dukenpark that i hope everyone will 
bother to find and enjoy. Have fun dukeing it out in 2012. So long! 

MetHy:
E5L1: I wanted to make this map as an introduction for the episode and I think it is quite succesful. 
Despite its short length (my first one-day map), I think it is quite successful in creating a nostalgia
effect as being a mix between E1L1 and E1L2.

E5L5: Sex City. The map I'm the most proud of out of everything I've ever made for Duke.
The idea was to make a new version of XXX Stacy, while also giving that "Roch4" feel.
By that I mean that you go around the main part of the map on several layers, before getting into the main 
part and unlocking everything. Add to this a starting rooftop reminding of E1L1, some cheesy
classic Duke3D humour as well, connections to both the previous and the next maps in the episode,
quite a few secrets, and you got a great classic feel as a result.

E5L7: I had ideas inspired by Flood (E3L3 in the original game), but I had to ask Mikko to finalize
the map as well. He made 2 great indoor underwater environments that link the rest of the map really well.

E5L10 : I thought MRCK's train map was lacking something so I asked him, and he let me add a rooftop section
which I think breaks the flow of the redundant indoor wagons rather well. That's all I did in this map
(besides remaking enemy & item placement).


Merlijn van Oostrum:
I made my map in 1 day, so don't expect too much crazy stuff from me this time. Given the time constraints, I think I 
did a reasonable job of creating a simple city map in the classic, original style. The only real liberty I took is adding 
some (basic) unreachable scenery to the level, which is a lot better then those big grey walls from the original levels 
in my opinion. The best part is the bar. Also contains many nods to the original Red Light Disctrict level (as well as 
some others from the original game), since that one has always been one of my favorites. Enjoy!

Mikko Sandt:
I was lured into this project back in January 2010 by MetHunter. The idea of having only 24 hours to work on a map
(and that includes time not spent on mapping!) that'd resemble something you'd expect to find from the original four
episodes was cool and so I came up with Office Onslaught (January 31st, 2010), influenced by such maps as E4L7 and 
E3L8. My second map was built in the summer of 2010. At this point Merlijn van Oostrum had joined the project and 
MetHunter's second map had gotten a bit out of hand, resulting in a delay (we were working on this thing map by map 
in order to link the maps better). After MetHunter's Sex City got done, I started & finished LAPD with lightning speed 
on the 26th of August 2010. After this MetHunter started working on his flood map, which would take a year to wrap up. 
MRCK took the liberty to not let this stall him and started working on the maps that would take place before the epic
boss maps. Everything was supposed to be wrapped up before MRCK would travel to the New World in the spring of 2011
but we didn't even have the boss maps done yet at this point. Only in the summer of 2011 did it become apparent that 
the flood map wasn't going anywhere so MetHunter sent it my way and I finished it on a sweaty summer day. The second half
of 2011 was spent on getting the four boss maps done, two by me (one based on The Queen, another on an idea MRCK had
about Duke having to dodge the Emperor's rockets while circling a set of buildings, trying to find ammo), two by MRCK. 
(MetHunter too started a boss map where you'd face the Overlord but that never got past the start.) At this point 
everything was going fine despite MetHunter being largely MIA. We were aiming for a Christmas 2011/New Year's Eve release 
but that never materialized even though the maps were basically done: the travails of real life had gotten the better of 
MRCK. So then came the last Sunday of February on which MRCK sent all he had to me & MetHunter and five days later we had 
polished and fixed everything that needed to be fixed; Gambini joined at the last minute to beta test the episode.
