Description           : This is the sequel to my previous Christmas map called (of course) Xmas2k1.
			You're in a facility which put dangerous liquids into cans and sell it to other factories who need
			it. Not a problem, well, as long as it keeps this way. But it wouldn't be Duke3d if something 
			wouldn't go wrong! Yes, Aliens took over the facility to produce a big ammount of this cans full
			of poison. Stop them before they can attack earth! We will send you in, you will have to do the rest!
Additional Credits To : Big thanks to one of the talented mappers ever: Billy Boy, for his odd but oh so awesome "odd-sector
			effect".
			And big thanks goes to three other awesome mappers:
			Alejandro, Martijn and Merlijn for Beta Testing my map!

It's ok if you check my map in BUILD and see how I did certain things, probably you won't find out since I have my own way
of making effects which might look odd you hehehe. But then again, try to be original or just ask me!
