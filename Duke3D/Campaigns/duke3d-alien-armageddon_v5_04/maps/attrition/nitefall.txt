Misc. Author Info     : I started building maps for Duke Nukem 3d 4 years ago.
			My first map was fetusboy (The Duke Nukem Aquatic Museum), and 
			that was followed by the semi-sequel, Homeworld. Before leaving
			the country to seek a life of fame and fortune in the
			Far East, I served as director of Episode Three for the
			Critical Mass TC project (see below). I am currently
			a translator of Chinese text in Taipei, Taiwan.
Other Levels          : fetusboy.map (Duke Nukem Aquatic Museum), Homewrld.map (Home1 & Home2)
Date of Completion    : January 2001
Description           : Story: 
			Night has fallen on a war-torn city somewhere on
			Earth and the aliens are heavily entrenched. Duke
			finds himself in a cramped alley armed only with his
			trusty pistol. Your objective is to make it to the 
			subway station in one piece. Good luck.
			Features:
			-Extremely large (1014 sectors, over 200 monsters).
			-Extensive use of sector-over-sector to simulate real
			 architecture (one building contains 5 directly overlapping
			 but interconnected floors).
			-Contains demo cameras.

Important Notes        : I originally built this map as part of the Critical Mass
			Total Conversion project. At the time, it represented a 
			culmination of all my BUILD skills. This version has been 
			redone using v1.3 textures. After the sudden disappearance
			of Tom Welsome (project director), the project went dead
			and has remained so for over two years. I have finally decided to
			release this map, which has been sitting unplayed in my
			computer for the past three years, in the hopes that perhaps a 
			handful of people would get the chance to play it before
			Duke Nukem 3d dies as well. I regret that it has come to this,
			because Critical Mass would truly have been an awesome
			piece of work, but as this is only one map and I have
			other projects to attend to, here it is. Enjoy.

NOTE: Any and all comments would be greatly appreciated. (see E-mail address above)
