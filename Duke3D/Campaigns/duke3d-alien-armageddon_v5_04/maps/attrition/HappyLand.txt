Misc. Author Info      : Long ago made maps like CrashTV, DeathMountain, DMZ, mods like SR2Duke and the
                         awesome I-Duke!
Description            : New map completed in 2021! lol. Medium sized, detailed, action packed map that
                         is designed to be awesome for all modes: single player, co-op and deathmatch. 

Version of Duke        : Made on version 1.3d. Works with all versions I imagine
Story                  : Twas a bright and sunny day in L.A.
                         Duke gets word that another cycloid emperor and his crew are in town. He searches
                         the city in an armored truck looking for them. Suddenly 2 alien bastards in an old
                         convertible chevy clack shots at him and take off. A chase ensues. Duke follows
                         them into a parking lot outside the old water park. He grabs his 9 and gets out 
                         only to realize he was lured into a trap. "Fuck it", sneered Duke, "Let's Rock!"

Bonus!                 : Included in the zip is the I-Duke mod (for original version 1.3d only)
                         Play a much more exciting version of Duke with lots of blood and custom guts, 
                         reprogrammed and harder enemies, some new actions, effects, changed guns and more!
                         (to set it up backup your original Game.con, User.con and Defs.con and then
                          copy the files into your Duke3d folder and have fun)
