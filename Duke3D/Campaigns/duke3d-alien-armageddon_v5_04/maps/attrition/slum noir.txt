No difficulty setting optimizing, has a overall low brightness for mood. (if you are in sunlight, jack up that gamma).
Tested and built with software renderer in mind, polymer does look pretty damn sweet due to glowing in the dark but seems to have slightly more bugs.

/___STORY___/

Welcome to the slums of of Neo L.A.
Home to the notorious addicts, keeper of the spike in crime rate.
A place where the alien infestation was just the extra needed bit of saturation to complete the picture.

Duke just got shot down again due to something that seems like an ambush.
Luckily, in the distance looms the quick escape trough the subway.

This is my first Duke map that I managed to complete and it took about 2-3 months to get it to this state.
One of the actual bigger maps that I have ever managed to complete in any engine, about time!

Features some obvious SOS trickery all around, along with a few scripted cut scenes done by sound alone.
However still very stock as the map should be playable in DOS Duke if it was split in to two parts (I broke the wall limit a long time ago).

Whole map started from a simple idea of trying to create a weird tech look from my head along with some Lameduke
city map design for inspiration. Idea kind of ended up being this "alternate universe" Duke3D that was somewhere
closer to Lameduke's grittier cyberpunk look where people love to shove neon lights everywhere.

I am pretty happy with the overall result, more could have been done probably for a long time but I decided just to
finish what I have so that I won't try to over-engineer things too far, It's just a map anyway.

There are a bunch of secrets to find and a bit of build porno in places.

This all made me a lot more familiar with the build editor again as the last time I really used it actively was 
over 10 years ago. Things are sure a lot better, mapster32 having so many tiny but "must have" features over build.
See you on the next map.

Enjoy!

/____THANKS____/
  
Big thanks to 'Hot Multimedia / LHB' for his soundtrack 
All the testers and especially Daedolon for providing valuable feedback, a lot of the good stuff is in there because someone had to show me how stupid some things are.
Also thanks for the feedback in the duke4.net forums that helped me squash a few bugs and add some tiny improvements for v2.
