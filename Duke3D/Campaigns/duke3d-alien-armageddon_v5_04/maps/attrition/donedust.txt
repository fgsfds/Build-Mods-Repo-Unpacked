Plot                  : A race of aliens known as The Assault have invaded a human facility located
                        on an island sixty miles off the coast of California. The facility personnel
                        have presumably been killed, but it's not known for sure. The loss of this
		        facility is a major setback to research into alien physiology as the facility
			contains several important Protector Drone samples and gigabytes of research
                        data. For these reasons the facility itself cannot be bombed: The samples
                        and the data must be recovered, assuming they haven't been destroyed by the
                        invaders. It is for this reason that you are sent to investigate the facility,
			to gather intel for our strike forces that'll take over the mission once your
			job is done.

                        Your mission is as follows:
                        1) Investigate the facility, keeping an eye on potential human survivors,
                           preserved research data and Protector Drone samples. It is not, however,
                           up to you to recover any of these.
			2) Blow up the primary reactor. This should considerably lower their defense
			   capabilities, paving the way for our strike forces
                        3) Once done, establish contact with the strike forces who will then proceed
			   to take over the mission
                        4) Escape via the northern waterway leading to the sea


Level Info  	      : Mikko Sandt: About five years ago I received a bunch of old map scraps from quakis
			who's a bit infamous for starting many projects without ever actually finishing them.
			Many of the scraps consisted of only a few corridors and/or rooms but they shared a 
			common hi-tech theme. Having missed the 12th MSDN anniversary update, I decided to make
			up for it by doing something with these scraps, which I had kept in mind over the years. 
			(I had previously finished two usermaps that had been worked on by someone else but never 
			finished.) I recovered the scraps from my old computer and went through them several times 
			to see what would be the best way to tie them together. In the end, seven scraps ended up 
			in the final map. After this merger (which involved a bit of copypasting, flipping, 
			raising/lowering floors/ceilings and filling in some blanks) and after implementing gameplay 
			dynamics (keys, buttons and monsters) I sent the map to quakis who held it for a week 
			during which he modernized and streamlined the map's more than 5-year-old architecture.

			quakis: I never expected these map sections to be used and once I took the map off Mikko's
			hands, I gave myself only a week to edit the map as much as I could. The layout and basic
			gameplay was there, but I thought it felt a bit lifeless and generic to play through. Over
			that week I worked on redesigning many locations and some areas were completely remade. The
			gameplay also became more refined, adding in that needed bit of life and little effects here
			and there. The map as a whole is considerably different from the version Mikko had sent and
			I felt pleased with the work I managed in a week.
