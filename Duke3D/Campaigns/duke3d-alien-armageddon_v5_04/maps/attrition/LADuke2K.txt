Description:      Sweet Duke3D 1.3 level made by myself, Big hotel with niteclub etc.
		  I think its awesome, you check it out for yourself! Dont worry it isnt 
		  a pathetic undetailed and boring map like all those others out there.
	          I made the map intending for it to have an atmosphere, lottsa eye candy
	          and really fun to play! You tell me what you think.
