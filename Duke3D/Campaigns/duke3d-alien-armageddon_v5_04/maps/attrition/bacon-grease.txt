Misc. Author Info       : I was pretty active in the Duke Nukem 
			  3D mapping community during the early 
			  90s, particularly on the Dukeworld 
			  forum. I also had a general Duke Nukem
			  3D fan site on Geocities and was 
			  involved in the Final Sundown TC
			  before it was cancelled.

Description             : Bacon Grease is a rather typical city map with particular attention payed to a grimy mood and a strong sense of place. You'll make your way through the streets of a besieged city, encountering a mix of commercial, residential, industrial, shopping, and transit locations. 

Some background - the map was actually started in 1999 as part of a TC called Final Sundown. After the TC was cancelled I began repurposing it and my other Final Sundown maps for an episode replacement called Departed. I lost interest in the project and never finished it.

Fast forward 23 years to 2022. While working on my visual design portfolio I wanted to collect some of my formative work, going as far back as my days of making Duke Nukem 3D maps. I decided I would get the ones closest to completion into a releasable state. So here we have one of them, after a few months of acclimating myself to modern expectations and tools. Due to the time gap the environment design stems from a mix of the perspective of a naive small town American teenager, to my modern experience of living in Berlin, Germany.

Known Bugs              : The artwork secret can be opened
                          without breaking the protective glass,
                          but I've found no way around this.

			  This apartment also has a skylight,
			  which makes no sense because it's on
			  the ground floor. Oh well!

			  And lastly, the final outdoor area
			  is shaded with a light source in the
			  opposite direction from the rest of
			  the map. It was an accident, but
			  after doing it "correctly", I decided
			  I preferred the original.

			  Please reach out if you find any
			  other bugs!

Important Notes         : Intended for EDuke32 and Polymost. Not
			  designed for Polymer. Classic renderer
			  may result in a few sprite related
			  bugs.
