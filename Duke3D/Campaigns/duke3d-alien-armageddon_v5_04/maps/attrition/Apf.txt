Description           : 

INTEL REPORT 5/4/14
The atmospheric processing facility on Venus has been operating for 
some 10 years now, turning that planets dense atmosphere into a 
breathable form. However we have just received word that the facility 
has been captured by alien forces, despite the efforts of the facility 
staff. We can only assume that they intend to harness the plant's 
equipment to make Venus more hospitable to their own biology. If they
are successful, it will give them a safe haven from which to launch
continuous assaults against Earth.

Your mission is to infiltrate the facility and eliminate all opposition.
Your goal should be to set the auto destruct on the power transformer for
the atmospheric electrostatic condensers - you'll know them when you see
them. This will effectively render the base useles until repair staff
arrive - with luck, the aliens will abandon it.

Be advised that alien reinforcements are on the way, and it is likely
that they will drop in troops from orbit.

Good luck!

NOTES:
When I first started building this level, I wanted it to be the best map
I'd ever made, with the most detail, and I think I've succeeded. I wanted
to build a map that was as drab looking as possible, so I used as little
colour as I could (with a few important exceptions). I would often render
sprites or textures with Palette 12, which eliminates most colour and turns
them grey. I also kept a much tighter control over the shading than I have
in previous levels - the result is a dark, washed out look that I'm very
pleased with.
The level is very, very large. I didn't keep track of the Sector count, and
as a result I ran out of sectors before the map was even close to being
finished. Luckily a lot of the sectors were copies of copies, detailed
sectors I was hoping to include in the final version. I deleted them which
gave me the leeway I needed to complete the level.
As a single player / co-op map it is very long and involved. As a Dukematch
map it's fine as long as the players stick to one area! I've tried to limit
access to other areas to make it playable as a Dukematch map.
Hope you enjoy it, and I'd love to get some feedback!
