* Play Information *

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: THIS MAP IS DESIGNED, TESTED AND MEANT TO BE PLAYED IN SOFTWARE MODE AND WITH AN UNMODIFIED DUKE3D ATOMIC EDITION COPY.
OTHER PORTS, RENDERERS, ENHACEMENT MODS, AND HIGH RESOLUTION PACKS ARE UNSUPPORTED AND NOT RECOMMENDED. USE THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK: THE MAP IS NOT GOING TO WORK/LOOK AS IT IS INTENTED TO.

PUT THE AUTOEXEC.CFG FILE THAT COMES IN THE PACK IN YOUR EDUKE32 FOLDER IF YOU´RE GOING TO PLAY THE MAP USING POLYMOST. OR SIMPLY TYPE r_shadescale 1.14 IN THE CONSOLE AT THE LEVEL STARTUP.

A quick list of the most noticeable issues when ignoring this advice (skip it if you´re going to play it as described above):

JFDuke: Game crashes randomly. No fog pals. Some distant sprites blink in big scenarios.

Proasm Duke3dw: Same than above but a bit more stable.

Polymost (any port): Scenarios are wrongly illuminated and atmosphere lacking. Some surfaces look pitch-black (only new eduke32, fixeable writting r_shadescale 1.14 in the console or including the autoexec.cfg).

Polymer: Same than above but worse. Plus: Performance issues, sprites clipping each other in the signs, SOME VITAL ELEMENTS IN THE LEVEL AREN´T VISIBLE, hardcoded lights in the switchs spoil secrets.

Dukeplus: Requires an unsuported renderer. Also, enemies are smarter which makes the level too hard. The "too many sprites" crash is plausible. And monsters just dissapear frequently. In the other hand, i´ve added a bunch of special effects to use with Dukeplus, it´s a good candidate if the monsters dissapearance is fixed.

Polymost/polymer HRP: unaccurate and ugly looking, wrong colors all over the level. Terrible performance. Do not even try it.


Software mode in full screen (wide screen monitors) wrong ratio aspect, the image looks stretched.

=======================================================================

Single Player          : Yes, in software mode.
DukeMatch 2-8 Player   : No
Cooperative 2-8 Player : No. Too many scripted sequences. Imposible to set for more than one player.
Difficulty Settings    : No
Plutonium Pak Required : Yes
New Art                : No
New Music              : No, the usermap music ¨dethtoll¨ fits perfectly this level.
New Sound Effects      : No
New .CON Files         : No

=====================================================================

* Construction *

Base                   : New level from scratch
Level Editor(s) Used   : Mapster32, Lebuild 1.03´s map error checker and sectnum changes (until Helixhorned came up with the script_expertmode).
Art Editor(s) Used     : No new art, therefore no art editor needed.
Construction Time      : Almost three years, with lots of breaks in between.
Known Bugs/Problems    : There´s no fucking way to make a map work in all the ways Duke Nukem is played these days. I did my best trying to make a wide compatible map, including polymer lights, dukeplus effects and tweaking things (as model angles) for the HRP. You won´t experiment any issue playing the map in software mode, with the latest unnoficial Eduke32 and without enhacement mods (unless i missed something).

=====================================================================

*Important Information*

Installation           : Just drop the map file in your duke folder. Launch eduke32 and browse the it_lives 1.00.map file in the "usermap" episode. I included an autoexec.cfg file, but if you don´t want to use it and will play the map with opengl, write r_shadescale 1.14 in the console before starting.

Important Notes        : This map has been designed to be played in software mode.
