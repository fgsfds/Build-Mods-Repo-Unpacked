			  any of my maps!

Description             : This map is about a fast food
			  restaurant(Duke Burger). There
			  are streets around it and a police
			  station too! Weapons and ammo are
			  are scattered all across the map so
			  you wont find yourself searching
			  weapons and ammo in dukematch while
			  other players are hunting you down!
			  Plenty of action guaranteed!

Credits			: First of all Ken Silverman for
			  creating the BUILD engine which
			  really kicks ass!

			  Jonathon Fowler for programming the
			  amazing JFDuke!(hope JFSw is not far away!)

			  My mates who playtested it.

Construction		: This map was built using JFBuild, which
			  really is conveniant if you dont have an
			  old computer at home :)

			  Build Time was about a month, but there was
			  a 2 year build pause between it.
