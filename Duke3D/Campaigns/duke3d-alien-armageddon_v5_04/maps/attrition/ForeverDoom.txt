Misc. Author Info       : This is a Doom tribute 
Other Levels            : 

Description             : This map is a Doom tribute/dedication and the design was mainly inspired by Doom 3 although nothing is exact. I also have added some surprises whcih include a few of my personal favorite areas from Doom 1 knee deep in the dead episode almost making this the Ultimate Doom map! Story : The Doom marine has left his hellified space base abandoned because he is out working on Doom4 those alien bastards know it is the time to take over his base. While he is away his base is being attacked and if it takes to long the base will be Forever Doomed and un fixable. So he contacts the one guy who fits the description of being able to save the day Mr. Duke Nukem. Mission: Explode the archives buildings so the aliens can't hack the computers system and clear out any aliens for a safe return of the Doom marine.
