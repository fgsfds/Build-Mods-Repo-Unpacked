Description           : Aliens captured a shopping center in Los Angeles.
		        They are working on the plan of a great
			invasion which can cause serious damage to the
			Earth. Nobody knows anything about their plans.
			Nobody can get it ... One moment ...! Duke!
			Would you like to take a trip to the main
			terminal in Mega Plaza? It lies somewhere in the
			Media Store. You are our only chance of survival!
			Get those plans while the rest of the army puts
			some C-9 there. We will be waiting for you at
			exit no. 2. Your task won't be easy.
			Good luck, Duke! 

If you think the story is bad, well, make up something better -
what do you expect from me, it's almost midnight and I have to
go to school tomorrow ...

			     - Hmmm ... Don't stand too close!
                        - 2. If you open the door of the toy shop and

			     red line/thing on the floor and on the ceiling,
			     nothing serious ...
                             - Hmmm ... Close your eyes!
