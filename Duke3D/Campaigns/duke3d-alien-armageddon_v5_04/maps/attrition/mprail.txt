Description             : Alien-attack blah blah... just kick ass
			in this railwaystation. Losely based on
			Rotterdam Central Station and Amsterdam
			Central Station (both in the Netherlands).

			A negative point about my previous maps was
			that they were all quite 'dead' or 'passive'
			because of the lack of gore, blood,
			explosions and special effects. I've done
			something about that now! Everything must
			blow!!	
                          
Additional Credit to    : 3D Realms for making this kick-ass game.
			And to you of course, for wasting time
			playing my maps
