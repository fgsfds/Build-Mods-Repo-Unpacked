Description           : I and Turpuli once met on the internet and asked him if he would like to make a map with me.
			He said okay and so we started (this was around February 2001). I did a lot for the map and I was 
			almost done already while Turpuli had not even finished the supermarket yet. Later we kinda lost 				contact, don't know why and the map was around 95%, so just 5% from being done. I never deleted the 				map and didn't touch it either, till today! I thought, oh fuck it, why not finish it? Would be a 				shame not to finish! The quality of the map is not of the quality my maps have at this time and even 				back then I could do better! But that's all on purpose since we wanted to create a map with the 				original Duke Nukem 3D maps but just a little more detailed. That's also why this map is called 				Retrospective!

Turpuli's additions   :	Yeah, I'm the one to blame for the veeery slow progress on this map..  I don't remember what it was
			but something kept me from building the map.  I'm not sure if this version is finished/polished on
			Kef's side, but at least you'll see what I planned to build (and did build).  As you can see, I used
			the sewer part in my later map "Extermination" :)  Yes, it was first built for this map...  I thought
			that it was too good to waste so I used it in another map :)



Additional Credits To : Why should I, noone helped me or anything, well maybe Bob Averill for looking at this map a year ago?
