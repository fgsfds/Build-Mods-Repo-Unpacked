SECRETS:

1)  In the "Guns and Boos" armory store press the spacebar on the cash 
register to open up the secret pathway to the rpg weapon displayed in the 
front of the store.

2)  Find the gray platform where the jetpack is located.  You can jump into
one of the windows near and above that platform into a secret room.  Try it!

3)  You can break the elevator doors on the bottom and top of the "117" 
building with the sign "Out of order" and jump into the elevator pathway.
If you fly from the lobby floor elevator pathway all the way up to the top -
you can break open the bottom of the elevator with a bomb or the rocket.
After doing so, you can fly into the broken elevator from beneath it.  
Weapons await you there!

4) On the left side of the hotel sign outside - fly up and into the 5th floor
5th window to the left.  A secret room awaits you!
