                  Please send me any comments about this map
                  If you post it on your web page, please tell me you've done
                  it so I can appreciate...

Misc.Author Info: I'm French (sorry for my English)

Other Levels    : Roch, Roch2, Roch3, Roch_sc1, Roch4, Roch5, Roch6.

Other stuff     : DukeRoch, a Windows Duke3d launcher, which also allows you
                  to test all Duke3d sounds and musics, browse and test .GRP
                  files, and more...

Description     : My eighth map. The seventh in the series - Roch_sc1 will be
                  the 1st secret level in the episode if I finish it one day.

                  Some cool effects/tips & tricks

                  3 secret places.

                  I've made this map "anti-linear". Four main buildings are
                  unlocked with the same color key, so you'll have 24
                  different routes possible to complete it! Good luck.

                  I managed to mount my drum kit - I thought I couldn't when I
                  did Roch2 (in a secret place). And yes, some of you may
                  notice that I'm left handed, but on drums ONLY!

                  If you love this map like I do and would like to know where
                  all secrets are, mail me to get a demo file that shows
                  everything (or to get my previous / future levels).
