Misc. Author Info     : I앐 20(!) years old and I still enjoy and want to
			build my own levels for Duke Nukem 3D. It압 an old
			classic game now but it still rocks, right?			
Other Levels          :	Most famous are: One2zerO, NeLiEx and WareHous
Description           : A city level with lot압 of different stores, in-
			cluding a library and a cinema. Yes, there are a
			lot of secrets (10!) in this level and some may be 
			hard to find and some may not seem to be a secret, 
			anyway you앏l see for yourself!
Story		      : Duke has once again saved the world all by himself
			from the alien creatures. He has also finished it
			off once and for all by killing the most powerful
			of them all, the Battlelord, and secured that he앏l
			not resurrect once again by shooting his head off.
			   When he wakes up the next day, in a hotel in 
			Gotham City, he hears some aliens growl. The special 
			police force in space was sent out to earth to 
			locate the alien crew who disappeared from the 
			radar in space. Duke polishes his sunglasses, puts 
			his boots on and loads his gun. He smiles and says: 
			"It압 time to kick ass and chew bubble gum. And I앐 
			all out of gum!"
