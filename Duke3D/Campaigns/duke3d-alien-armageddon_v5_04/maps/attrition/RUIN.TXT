Description             : Single player is challenging, as you are very
                          limited for equipment and you are constantly
                          hunted by sentry drones. Your goal is to escape the
                          ruined cityscape by blasting open a barricade at
                          the east side of the city. Surviving long enough to
                          get there is difficult, and I recommend you rely on
                          sneaking around instead of rushing into battle.

                          Dukematch design allows the player to stay in
                          different areas (example, the lower streets) without
                          running out of equipment. This allows people to
                          pick whatever play style they want, but emphasis is
                          on sniper attacks and ambushes.
