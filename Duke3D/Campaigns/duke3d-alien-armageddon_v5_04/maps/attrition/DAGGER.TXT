Description           : I didn't actually build this with a story in mind,
                        I just pieced it together from various ideas that
                        came to me during the 5 month build time. Anyway
                        some pirates used to use this underground cavern
                        as a hide-out, they called it Dagger's Cavern. This
                        cavern also served as a way to get to and fro a deep
                        underground uh, place, which i suppose you can call
                        hell, which an alien guy rules over, your supposed
                        to pretend he's, like, the devil or something... 

                        Duke was on vacation with his girlfriend, driving along
                        in his car, when he becomes suddenly distracted by...
                        something.. and the car flys off a mountain and smashes
                        through the ground. Duke, being the tough guy that he is,
                        survives the crash, unfortunatly his girlfriend did not.
                        He climbed his way out of the car and into some sort of
                        cave. Looking around, he saw a light in the distance.
                        "Hmm, whats that up there. Better check it out, too bad
                        I don't have my shotgun with me." Turning his head, he found
                        lying on a rock nearby, his shotgun, which must have fallen
                        out of his car in the crash.....
