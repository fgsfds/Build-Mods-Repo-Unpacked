James' part:
My part is a quake-style area, with a cold outside area. Originally it was intended for Classic mode without HRP but I'm sure it looks fine in OpenGL. The map ground to a complete halt due to commitments in real life as well as other projects, but eventually the project picked up steam again and is now finished since you're reading this. I hope you enjoy the map and the work we put into it, and I'm sure that I'll personally take part in another CBP project soon enough.

Geoffrey's part:
..sorry ¯\(º_o)/¯

Mikko's part:
You're dropped to my part from Geoffrey's (that's Fakir!) cool complex of corridors and the part lasts until you pass the "Messhall" door to Q-dude's part. The part is very basic in terms of both gameplay and details. It's a bit too x-axis but I had only 800 walls to work with. This is also why I wasn't able to add many cool lightning tricks. I had problems aligning textures and shading due to whatever reason - could be because I started by copying the sky and some textures from Q-dude's part. The outdoor part is maybe a bit Q2ish. I tried to stick with the theme the map had so far. As for the strange white place - I had ran out of walls at this point so I couldn't even insert a simple point. So adding this strange white place was the lesser bad thing to do.

Quakis's part :
My last CBP due to the quality I make my parts, low. I was never happy with my first area I built which was some grey area without much of a purpose. Therefore I used a detailed cafe I worked on for another project since I was afraid it'd never get used and go to waste. This also breaks up the high tech theme a bit for few minutes. Better than before but still not happy with it, I can do so much better but I never felt like working on it, don't expect anything special in my part.

Due to some misunderstanding of an unfinished map in a pack Kuffi released, which is originally mine, I now have two parts. The second being a bar area. This originally was going to be a small CBP with Kuffi but it never got anywhere. Methunter also did some extra tweaks to the section as well but it's still a bit empty, yet we wanted to get this thing out as soon as possible.

Merlijn and Maarten's part:
Our part (the Oostrum facility) is yet another hi-tech base, a very detailled an dark one.
Mostly inspired by Doom3. The central room is even completely based on a Doom3 location.
Looks best with hi-tile, some parts might be too dark when you use classic mode.
Have fun!

MetHunter's and Quakis's parts :
I (MetHunter) built from the sewers area after Willy's part to the end of the map. Except for the concert room which was given to the project by Quakis, but I added toilets to it and I filled the stage and the aquarium.
It is best played using the HRP.
