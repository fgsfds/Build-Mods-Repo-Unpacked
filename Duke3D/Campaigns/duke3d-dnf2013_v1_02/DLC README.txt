Additional Credits    :

Thanks to:	Lunick, Loke and Blizzart (From Duke4.net forums) for beta testing.
			Davox thanks:
			Gambini for helping create the rotating door effect in the stadium and having lots of patience with me;
			after being absent for so long I forgot most of the effects.
			Cursed Lemon For re-creating his Grabbag Rendition specifically for the Motorcycle level, he was very friendly 
			and was extremely fun to work with.
			Mike Norvak for taking time off his busy schedule to create the awesome exclusive music for the Stadium Level!
			And Mikko Sandt for packing all this together since we're noobs regarding CON coding.

======================================================================

* Install Information *

The original DNF (2013) mod is required. Once you have it, toss the contents of the DLC zip into your DNF 
mod folder. Then simply run DLC.bat.

* Renderer Information *

This mod is intended to be played in the 8-bit classic (Software) mode. The Open-GL Polymost mode is also
supported but not recommended (except by 1/2 of the team). If you play in Polymost, Gambini would probably
recommend you to put this in the console: r_usetileshades 1

The stadium map works best in Classic mode mostly due to the heavy use of TROR in the final stage.

Polymer and the HRP are definitely NOT supported and are thus disabled.

=======================================================================

Single Player          : Yes
DukeMatch 2-8 Player   : No
Cooperative 2-8 Player : No (maybe we'll think about an update if EDuke32's multiplayer gets finished, maybe not)
Difficulty Settings    : Yes, except for the bike and stadium maps.
Atomic Edition Required: Yes
New Art                : Yes
New Music              : Hell Yes
New Sound Effects      : No
New .CON Files         : Yes

=====================================================================

* Construction *

Base                   : Levels made from scratch with heavy influences from the 1998 DNF trailer and the 2011 DNF game.
Softaware used	       : Mapster32, DukeRes, GRP Viewer, Irfanview.
Construction Time      : About six months.
Known Bugs/Problems    : Small issues related to TROR in the 3rd level, only for those who use Open-GL.
	                       Some oddities when trying to drive the motorcycle using the mouse (try not to
	                       move it while on the bike, and use the strafe keys instead). In the first level 
	                       of the DLC episode, some of the level geometry in the large canyon area glitches 
	                       at certain angles, possibly due to the large size of it.

* Author Notes *

DLC Story (spoilers):
---------------------
There's no more story to this than there is the original Duke 3D, but it goes something like:
"Duke is enjoying his vacation in a strip club after thwarting the alien's plan to take over Hoover Dam
and open a portal. When the aliens attack he escapes and ultimately makes his way to a rocket that will 
get him to the Duke Dome ASAP where he can fight and kill the Cycloid Emperor. However the rocket is shot
down and he has to go the rest of the way on bike. He then gets to the Dome and kicks ass."

About the 1998 map:
-------------------
When I first played the mod I fell in love with the layout, architecture and feel (not to mention the countless trailer and screenshot
references). But I somehow felt it needed more, especially from the 1998 trailer. At first I told myself "I'm NOT going to build a map,
I've got too many projects both for Duke and real life stuff", but I decided to mess around and build a version of the 1998 trailer strip
club. I liked it so I decided to build little bit more, then a bit more, then a bit more... and before you know it I had built most the map.
Probably the fastest I've ever been able to make a map. Of course it took a lot longer to polish than to actually make, but I managed to work 
in several other trailer references like the UFOs, the tall canyon near the end of the map, a version of the "now that's what I call a close 
encounter" scene in a viewscreen, and something else for those who find the super secret ;)

I was actually going to build a second map, which greatly expanded on the facility at the end, and would have had some cool ideas like Duke
actually fighting aliens from on top of flying UFOs (blended that area in as the super secret without the UFOs), as well as a "shrunken" 
section in a giant Dukeburger-like kitches like the 2011 DNF, which I half finished. But progress was too slow and I decided to focus my 
efforts on making the first map as good as possible instead, which I still believe was the best decision.

Still, even without the 1998 trailer references I think the map still has enough unique ideas in it to justify itself as a fun stand alone map.
I managed to pull off a few things using TROR (allowing some extra 3D level design), but Gambini wanted me to keep it glitch free in the least
stable renderer for that, which forced me to keep it simple compared to what I might have done (otherwise UFOs could have been flying everywhere.
The map was built from scratch, save for the use of Episode 1's EDF trucks near the EDF base, copied for the sake of consistency.

About the stadium map:
----------------------

Pheww... This finally saw the light of day. 
As some of you already know, the stadium level was suppossed to be a one map thing. To showcase Polymer, HRP and the new Cycloid
From Tea Monster. It was also going to feature new Cycloid attacks by Dan Gaskill. We are talking about end of 2010 here.
First I made a rough approach as to what the stadium should look like, starting with the famous bathroom and my speed building video
making it. At that time it was only lit by Polymer lights.

A shitload of years later the DNF 2013 MOD was released and I was pumped, I mean, I thought to myself "Damn , I have to finish
That goddamned map..." and so I started building it again. Since the mod uses only classic mode I had to get rid of the HRP, Polymer and
Unfortunately, the new cycloid model as well. A good portion of the map was already built at the time, but I had to lit everything from
Scratch since it had no shading at all with polymer lights. 

With that map I made for the first time (and probably last) some awesome spritework that you're going to love. Specially if you lift ( ;) )

By the time I completed the map we couldn't get new con for the cycloid so I had to try my best on bringing a good fight only with basic old
school mapping (and TROR hehe). I like the result, yes It could've been better but that's true for all projects out there, right?


About the motorcycle map:
-------------------------

Finally!!, yes I say finally again because I've always wanted to create this kind of map, ever since I got my hands on a level editor for the 
first time. 

When I first started mapping for Duke3d I would always try to find a way to create a vehicle pursuit kind of level. The closest I've ever got 
to creating something like that can be seen on my Buenos Aires Explosive Remake level, when you enter a bus and stuff explodes everywhere until
it crashes. But that wasn't What I always intented. What I really wanted was something like a 2 way train that went from one end of the map to 
the other. It would've been kinda boring and tedious I know... making like 10 buildings would mean 10 seconds of gameplay (something like this
happened to me with the motorcycle map).

As soon as I played the great motorcycle map by Gambini on the DNF mod, I was blown away! Yes! This is what I wanted to make for all this time!
So when I finished the Stadium map I started working on the motorcycle map, working 8 or 9 hours everyday for a month straight.
I like the result, and I hope you like it too. 

This is probably my last work for Duke3D, this is what I leave to the community that gave me company all these years of youth and joy.

Stay tuned for one more thing Duke related, my Octabrain Sculpture :).

Thanks for reading all this and go have fun!
