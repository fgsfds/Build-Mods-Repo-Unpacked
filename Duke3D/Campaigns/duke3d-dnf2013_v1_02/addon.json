  "description": "https://msdn.duke4.net/dnf2013.php\n\nDuke Nukem Forever 2013 is a 5-level mod for Duke Nukem 3D. It's essentially what Duke Nukem Forever, the game, might have been if it had been released as an expansion for Duke Nukem 3D. The assets and the levels have been greatly influenced and inspired by the 2001 Duke Nukem Forever E3 trailer, the very trailer that seemed to promise the imminent arrival of the best video game ever. Other trailers and preview screenshots were also used as sources.\n\nAlso includes 3-map DLC."
