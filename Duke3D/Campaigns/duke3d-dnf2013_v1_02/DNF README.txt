INSTALL INFORMATION:

Unzip the contents of dnf.zip into an EMPTY DIRECTORY (call it whatever you want),
place a copy of Duke3d.grp (the Atomic Edition version) in that directory and run
DNF.bat. Make sure the directory is empty before you install this mod as outside
files will conflict with the mod. Do NOT replace the supplied _eduke32.exe with
your own as this mod has been optimized for the included version of EDuke32 and
other versions may cause undesired results.

Note to Steam users: Your Duke3d.grp is located in the following directory:
steam\steamapps\common\Duke Nukem 3D\gameroot\classic 
Steam users automatically have the required Atomic Edition version of the grp.

Title                 : Duke Nukem Forever 1.0
Authors               : Gambini & Mikko Sandt

Misc. Author Info     : There's only one reason we can stand each other and it's that
		                    we love Duke Nukem 3D.
Other projects        : Plenty, see the website (MSDN) above

Description           : This is, more or less, our idea of what Duke Nukem Forever would have been like had
			it been built on the Build engine. Our reference material consists mostly of the
			1998 and 2001 Duke Nukem Forever trailers. While the mod is heavily oldskool in
			style, it draws some inspiration from more recent games as well and would not exist
			without the modern capabilities of the EDuke32 engine.
                        

Additional Credits    : -Daniel "DeeperThought" Gaskill for coding the Wild Pig, the boulder, the assault
			rifle, the tentacles, the new cycler & earthquake effects, and several minor actors
			and for help with the bike's code.
			-Maxim "Lezing" Chinyakin for providing the astonishing motorcycle code and The 
			 Extended Color Look-up Table Pack.
 		        -Reaperman for his Duke3D Voxel Pack.
			
Thanks to:	      : - Methy for betatesting;
			- Richard "TX" Gobeille, Plagman and Helixhorned for their commitment to EDuke32
			and some special work made for us;
			- Pablo "Gambini Jr 1st" Gallo and Lucas "Gambini Jr 2nd" by lot of alpha testing and
			ideas.
			- The Duke4.net Community Stockpile for a few cool tiles;
			- Geoffrey "Fakir" van Dijk for the Minitank art;
			- Mike Norvak for the Wild Pig sounds and General Graves's voice cleaning;
			- Michael "Micky C" Crisp for TROR technical support and testing;
			- The Duke3D Informational Suite by Ryan Lennox for a list of sounds;
			
			And finally to all those who offered their help and provided positive feedback. We 
			didn't forget your names, but you were a lot, guys and lads!
			
			- The EDuke32 wiki and duke4.net forums were of immense benefit in aiding this mod's
			coder, who had no previous experience with coding. Several mods such as the AMC TC,
			Imagination World 2 TC, WGRealms 2 and The Wall	were also helpful treasure troves of
		        code.
			
      			Lots of sounds and music were obtained from the ill-fated 2011 realisation of Duke
			Nukem Forever. Other tracks are from Vectorman, Borderlands, Call of Duty: Black
			Ops 2 and Battlefield 3.
			Some sounds (the donkey's gallop, the terminator's laser, etc.) were obtained from
			online audio libraries and some enemies sounds are based on Monolith's games.
       
      			Also thanks to the many people who visited the Hoover Dam, took pictures of it and
			shared those pictures with the world. Dozens of these were used	when recreating the
			dam in Mapster32.

* Author Notes *

Mikko: I was lured into this madness very late last August (2012) by Gambini. Then the mod team
consisted of Gambini (mapping, art), DeeperThought (code) and Mike Norvak (mapping). However, as soon
as I joined, both DT and Norvak went AWOL so Gambini replaced Norvak as a mapper (Norvak was working on
a map based on the Ladykiller casino, which Gambini later built from scratch) and I replaced DeeperThought
as a coder, which was a pure accident. I originally had no other plans with respect to coding than to bring
in Fakir's "minitank" art as a new actor that'd be based on the Riot Tank's code.
This was the very first actor I coded for Duke3D despite having mapped for the game since late 1997. 
Gambini then started requesting code, a lot of which was way above my non-existent skill level. I didn't
wander off into the EDuke32 territory until after January 2013. We held a three-month long hiatus between
October 2012 and January 2013, during which Gambini worked on his Half-Life 2 project. As for the maps,
Gambini originally wanted something along the lines of Metropolitan Mayhem, a mini-mod that'd consist of
mostly quickly-built maps based on early plans for Duke Nukem Forever. Our ambitions grew, however. My dam
map was originally supposed to take place almost exclusively on the top of the dam but the map started to
grow in size and scope, aided by the fact that I had realized I could code new effects for the map. Tons
of locations from the actual dam are featured in the map: the Lake Mead reservoir, the water intake towers,
the road that runs through the top of the dam (there's a Nevada-Arizona state line in the middle), the
visitor center, the car park (unreachable), transmission towers, the power station, the lower-level turbine
room, the valve houses, the penstock, both Nevada & Arizona spillways, the memorial and, finally, the
bypass bridge. Tons of photographs were used as references and Gambini provided tons of art that helped
bring the map closer to its real-life counterpart.

Gambini: I was who started with this mod and also built four maps for it (although Mikko contributed a lot
with the EDF HQ map). I also did all the art except by some stuff we took from the community stockpile or 
other 3DR games. What I앐 mostly proud is the enemies I did. Being my first incursion on 8bits art, I must
admit I loved my own work. I made some voxels and even dared to touch someone압 else code to fuck things up.
It압 been a lot of fun to work on this mod. And Mikko has been a great team mate, even having to deal with
my "charming character" all the time, for all these months. Dan and Lezing also were both very helpful and
I앐 really glad of counting with their contribution. They gave us a big push.
