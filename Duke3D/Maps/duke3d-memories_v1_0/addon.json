  "description": "http://eddyprojects.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nThis level takes inspiration from the classic Duke 3D maps. I was feeling very nostalgic lately, and this level is very much inspired by that distant feeling! It features some cool places, such as Irish Pub and Pharmacy, which are done in low-fi, oldscool 90\u0027s style. I think, this style of mapping is very innocent and pure in its nature. Some of the areas are sampled from original Duke 3D maps.\r\n\r\nTo make it more interesting, I added some new graphics and gameplay items, which spice up the action somewhat. Level is pretty short, but I hope you\u0027ll get a kick from some of these gimmicks. Especially the new Bonus Backpack, which gives you random items that you might need to finish the map!"
