  "description": "The Duke Nukem 3D Penthouse Paradise level chronicles the little talked about R\u0026R period for Duke Nukem between the original Duke Nukem 3D Game and the Duke Nukem 3D: Plutonium Pak, the expansion addition.\n\nInquiring minds and the tabloids have been dying (and not by Duke\u0027s hands) to find out what happened to our intergalactic hero when he went for ...a little R\u0026R.\n\nFinally, this shocking level reveals all! While Duke was trying to establish a little beach-head, the Aliens have dropped in to break up his fun in the sun and spoil a couple of Penthouse photo shoots to boot. It\u0027s up to our man, Duke Nukem, to save the day - again.\n\nWith no time to play with his favorite Pets or work on his tan, Duke Nukem says, Somebody\u0027s gonna friggin\u0027 pay for screwin\u0027 up my vacation!\n\nWill Duke save the day, the shoots, and finally get that babe, a stogie and a bottle of Jack?\n\nIt\u0027s up to you to find out!"
