Description:		The Duke Nukem 3D Penthouse Paradise level chronicles the 
			little talked about R&R period for Duke Nukem between the 
			original Duke Nukem 3D Game and the Duke Nukem 3D: 
			Plutonium Pak, the expansion addition. 

            		Inquiring minds and the tabloids have been dying (and not 
			by Duke's hands) to find out what happened to our 
			intergalactic hero when he went for "...a little R&R." 
			Finally, this shocking level reveals all! 

            		While Duke was trying to establish a little "beach-head," 
			the Aliens have dropped in to break up his fun in the sun 
			and spoil a couple of Penthouse photo shoots to boot. It's 
			up to our man, Duke Nukem, to save the day - again. 

            		With no time to play with his favorite "Pets" or work on 
			his tan, Duke Nukem says, "Somebody's gonna friggin' pay 
			for screwin' up my vacation!" 

            		Will Duke save the day, the shoots, and finally get that 
			babe, a stogie and a bottle of Jack? 

            		It's up to you to find out! 


Tips we can tell you:
			
			-Tons of Penthouse Pets 
			-"On location" Penthouse photo shoots 
			-Duke's own hotel room
			-Duke's "other" hotel room
			-Duke's fondness for industrial dance tunes

Special thanks to:	Tyler Matthews (ty@synet.net) who worked night and day 
			to get this baby completed and he didn't get fired from his 
			job while dealing with Mark & Jeff's constant knit-picking 
			which probably drove him insane!  Way to go, Ty!  At least 
			you didn't go "postal."

* Play Information *

OTHER Notes:	There is new art with all of the Penthouse Pets (Tiles014.art). IF 
		YOU HAVE COPIES OF THESE FILES IN YOUR duke3d DIR, MAKE A BACKUP.

Getting Started:

		Run the PENTHOUS.BAT file from your Duke3D Directory.

		The PENTHOUS.BAT file runs a little program called CHECKVER.EXE, 
		which returns an errorlevel of 1 if the Duke version is 
		Atomic/PPak. Based on this, it'll launch either the Atomic/PPak or 
		1.3 versions of the .CONs, etc. After the initial check is done, 
		it then prompts you to select Single Player or Multiplayer 
		(Co-op/DukeMatch.) If you choose Single player, it kicks off the 
		special game.con, and no files are changed. 

Single Player:
		After you have selected the 1-player game, you must go through 
                the usual Duke Nukem options menu.  Select "new" and then choose the 
		difficulty level.
		
		If you are running the original Duke Nukem 3D game, you must select
		"L.A. Meltdown" and the "Penthouse Paradise" level will load.  If 
		you are running the Atomic/PPak version, "Penthouse Paradise" will
		load automatically within the "Episode" menu.

Multi Player:
		If you select Multiplayer, it will ask you if they'd like for the 
		batch file to rename the original .CON files as backup. If you 
		select "yes", it renames GAME.CON, USER.CON, and DEFS.CON to 
		*.PEN. It then copies over the Penthouse variety, and runs 
		SETUP.EXE for them. Once you are finished with the game, the batch 
		file then returns the originals. If you choose not to have the 
		batch file rename these files, it simply tells you that the special 
		sounds and code for Multiplayer support will not be available until 
		you rename your original .CON files. 	
		
		In the Setup Menu, select Network Game. In the Network Menu, select
		the number of players, and choose "penthous.map" from the user map
		menu. Once you have made your selections, click on 
		"Launch Duke Nukem 3d", then sit back and enjoy the ride.

Final Note:	Have some fun in the sun, and thank you for choosing Penthouse 
		Paradise Resorts, the number one place for "...a little R & R."
