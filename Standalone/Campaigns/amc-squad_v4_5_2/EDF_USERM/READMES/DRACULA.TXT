Description            : Dracula's Castle; created for the Duke Spook'em
			 mod and released as a demo of sorts. Made in about 3
			 days, I set a challenge to myself to not get bogged down
                         and actually finish some maps this year. Was made to be
                         relatively open ended.

			 This is the Eduke32 version of the map, which includes a 
                         couple of reskinned enemies (Zombie pigcop from Total Meltdown,
                         and a Cthulhu Octabrain by me) as well as OGG music from 
			 Superfrog for the Amiga (recorded by Kuokka77) and all the art
			 tiles renamed to use the per-map art tile feature by helixhorned.
