#### NOTE OF THE AUTHOR: The map RED5 is made for CLASSIC DUKE so it's best to play 
this map on CLASSIC MODE! Some things just don't look as good when doing otherwise. 
I might release a special Jonof version later, but for now: PLAY THIS MAP ON CLASSIC MODE! 
Thanks. :-) ####


Word from our sponsor (Restourant the Rock): "Try our new and improved kingsized

=============================================================================================================

General Description/mission:
The story moves on :)
The aliens have succeeded to let the boat collapse, but you
are still alive and eager to kick some alien ass. In this final map you'll finally
reach The lonely mountain complex, which is the HQ of the aliens. The futher
you go, the more you'll find out. Hurry up, becouse time is running out and it
seems like the aliens are winning!
Read the full story in the other txt-file :)
	
I also included the pre-red1 story, which gives a bit more background and makes things
more clear if you're interested. But it's a long roa.. erm read, you might be spending more
time reading then playing :P
It explains the mission of duke. Back in the day I made red1 I never
really tought out a good backstory, now there's one ;-)

I would also like to add that this is a quite hard map, so SAVE your game often.

  the way that seems best to you
============================================================================================================

    * Some info and tips *

- Again you can expect the unexpected. Keep your eyes open! Watch out for sudden traps
  and/or events all the time. Save your game often!
  There are some events you might NOT survive the first time, this map is hard! 
  Well you can't expect to just walk into a heavily guarded alien hq can you? :)	
  Again, SAVE OFTEN!
- Explore your entire environment for goodies, this greatly increases your change of 
  survival. Don't rush trough the map like an idiot ;-)
- This map has Dm-support, the arena is set in the outside location in the beginning. 
  To add to the fun there's also jetpacks available in this mode, so you can trow some
  airstrikes on your poor opponents  :-)
- There's one secret room, finding it is very.. rewarding ;-)
