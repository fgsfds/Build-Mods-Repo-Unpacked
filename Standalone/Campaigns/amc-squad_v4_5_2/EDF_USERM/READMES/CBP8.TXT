Email Address           : Just look for/make a thread at Comg Get Some Duke Forums (http://www.scent-88.com/forum/index.php)
			  Or Duke4.net Forums: (http://forums.duke4.net/)


Description             : It's a large, epic space city (making minor use of TROR) which the aliens have invaded. Visit exotic 
			  locations, wipe out the alien scum, and just to be on the safe side: activate the city's self destruct 
			  and blow everything to hell.


Misc. Author Info       : Author Comments

			Micky C: "I made my part second, in about 3 days. It's the interior of the Scent-88 building. I wanted 
			to make an interactive and dynamic appartment that as you walked around, changed from a fairly innocent 
			place into a full on love hub, somewhat inspired by Quagmire's house in Family Guy. I then integrated a 
			simple button puzzle into the dynamic design which turned out well (Norvak did a bit of polishing such 
			as re-texturing the floor and some extra lighting). Downstairs, I put a new spin on some classic Duke 
			places like Tiberius Station and Polaris Outpost based on their logos, and an AMC TC reference (don't 
			tell James). Finally, I designed the interior of the tower and the escape sequence where the city is 
			destroyed and you fly away in an escape pod. It took a LOT of planning and work to figure out and 
			implement a way of pulling it off then ending the level, but I'm happy with the result. I also touched 
			up the level in various places, such as the room with the exploding pillars and added a cool TROR secret 
			or two. I can't wait for the next CBP."

			High Treason: "After spending some time in the nice shiny city, Duke jumps down a manhole and enters the 
			not so shiny sewers, arriving at a sewerage treatment room, Duke must locate a key to allow him to progress 
			(to Captain Awesome's section). In contrast to the sections that existed when I was handed the map, I tried 
			to go more for the classic look and feel, partly because I've been plagued by technical problems, the section 
			is not my best work, but I'm satisfied with the outcome overall. When I first built things, they looked 
			different, the tanks were square with spritework linking them up, they also had transparent water but that 
			killed framerate so hard that I couldn't work on it anymore, so eventually, we arrived at what we have now."

			Forge:"Made the section after the player jet packs out of Captain Awesome's sewer area and before they exit 
			back out to Mike's central hub. Kill a couple aliens and figure out how to get back out to the hub area. 
			Nothing special; just a few typical rooms. Easily the worst and dullest section of the map."

			quakis: "Worked on the small urban section in the upper part of the main hub, which includes a police station 
			and EDF mechs. Also did some polishing around the map and made a few additions while doing so, like exterior 
			views (ex: window in Forge's section) and the small room near the manhole cover."

			Everyone else was too Chicken to write a section. So below are some general comments that cover all the mappers.

			   
			   General Comments

			Mike Norvak - Started the project at Duke4. Did his part and disappeared. Showed up, made "adjustments" that 
			broke a few people's sections and caused extra work. Disappeared again. Re-appeared with a half done audio file. 
			Disappeared. Reappered eventually with the full track and complaining about bugs.

			Michael "Micky C" Crisp - Co-started the project at CGS. Hogged all the resources and kept adding things like a 
			heroin fiend getting a fix.

			Paul "High Treason" Monteray - actually followed the rules of the build

			Mister Sinister - wrote some things for the template, got embarrassed even though there was nothing wrong with 
			what he said, ultimately had his comments removed. what a wuss

			Merlijn van Oostrum - did his thing, took up William Gee's slack, found one of his old pipes under the couch in 
			the basement, cleaned it out for the resin, showed up afterwards talking backwards and in colors, so we all 
			humored him with chips and mountain dew.

			Marteen van Oostrum - made his part then fell in a mob of groupies and hasn't been heard from since.

			Captain Awesome - took two weeks to build two days worth of mapping

			Forge - made a crappy section, then bitched alot to anyone who would listen

			quakis - this guy actually finished something?

			William Gee - showed up, took the map for two weeks, gave it back with a few empty rooms. Took it back again, did 
			nothing. What a guy.			




Additional Credits to   : Gambini (the slacker didn't even finish the map, and complained about getting lost too much),
			  SuperTanker, Green, Lunick for beta testing.
			  The Duke Community for being awesome.
			  TerminX, Plagman and Helixhorned for their work on eduke32 and the features that made this map possible.

=====================================================================

*Important Information*

Installation           : Extract the map and music to your Duke Nukem Atomic edition directory, then do one of the following to disable lights:
			 (1) Open up the console in-game with the "`" (tilde) key, then type "r_pr_lighting 0" without quotation marks and hit 
			 enter. To re-enable lights afterwards, so the same as above, but type "r_pr_lighting 0".
			 (2) Simply extract autoexec.cb8, autoexec.cfg (overwrite any old file) and CB8.bat to your eduke32 directory, and run 
			 CB8.bat. It will start the map without lights, and when it's done, the next time you start eduke32 with polymer, lights 
			 should be on again.
			 Alternatively you can play the map with lights enabled, however this will decrease performance, and spoil secrets.

Important Notes        : This map was designed for polymer with dynamic lights diabled. You may play with dynamic lights at your own risk.
			 If your computer is powerful enough for it then good for you, but it probably isn't. For those of you reading this
			 in 2047 and beyond then WOW the Duke community has lasted well, and framerate shouldn't be a problem.
			 Classic mode is mostly glitch-free (I'd say 97%), so use it if you must. Polymost at this time is absolutely not
			 supported due to extreme lack of TROR support.

* Play Information *

Episode and Level #     : mental blank,

Cooperative 2-8 Player	: nope,
DukeMatch 2-8 Player    : nope,
Difficulty Settings     : not implemented but if you suck use god mode or whatever (dnkroz),
New Sounds              : zero,
New Music               : zilch, oh wait, Norvak made an ogg.
New Graphics            : nadda
New/changed CONs        : null,
Demos Replaced          : as if people even use demos anymore,

=============================================================================================================================

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch.
Build Time              : It was originally meant to be a 1 week CBP (one week per mapper) but some people only took a few days,
			  while others hogged the map for weeks, so it turned into a "1 month-as many walls as you want" CBP that
			  took about 6 months. Don't judge us!
Editor(s) used          : Mapster32
Known Bugs / Problems   : Some minor sprite clipping issues in classic mode, in polymer you can kind of see the outside scenery through
			  the top window near the manhole you fly out of after the pillar room battle and it flickers a bit. From some angles,
			  certain parts of the level can be seen through the sky where they shouldn't be (polymer bug).


May Not Run With...     : 10 year old computers. Upgrade people! Upgrade! (And polymost).

* Copyright / Permissions *

You may not distribute this map, at all. I'm planning to sell it and make da moneys! Oh wait you're all a bunch of pirates anyway so
who cares, do what you want. 

* Where to get this MAP file *
Although you kind of need the map to have this .txt file to know where to get the map in the first place I'll provide the information anyway:
