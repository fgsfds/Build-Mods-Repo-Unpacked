Description             : Duke accidently find this weird semi lab semi factory base that uses illegal 
                          chemicals and radioactive materials that can harm the rainforest so duke must
                          destroy this base but this base is secured by scientist cops and others

Requirement             : Tile015.art file or otherwise the level will go ugly
                          Cduke3d or you wont see the cool flooring FXs
                          Be careful some enemy can shoot you so WATCH OUT!!!!


Tips                    : This is level is a bit hard not super hard i can pass
                          it without dying the size is small-mediun level about 10 to 15
                          min to pass it its full of new FXs and cool FXs
