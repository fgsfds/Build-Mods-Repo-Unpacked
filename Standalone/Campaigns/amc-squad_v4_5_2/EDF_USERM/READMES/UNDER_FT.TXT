Description             : - - - conclusion of west alien train - - -.... Duke is in the underground fortress quite a 
                          big base duke must survive in this fairly dangerous base with monsters in it. duke must find
                          the furnace of the base and try to increase the pressure of it and the core too -also- This
                          base uses illegal toxic chemicals that cause extreme environment threats - so be careful-


Tips                    :  This level is quite long it take 26 to 29 mins to pass it
                           This is a semi-strategic level so you must think in some parts
                           Save often!!!! as a reminder :-)
                           if for a necessary switch or etc some you must be at the center to press it
                           IMPORTANT TIP!!!!!!! When you overload the core you must not save

interesting fact        : this levels has FXs that no one else on earth did it as i known of
