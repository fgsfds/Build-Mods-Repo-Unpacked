*******************************

**ATTENTION TO ALL JONOF (polymost) USERS**

This map is made for CLASSIC MODE, NOT for JONOF IN POLYMOST. The map doesn't look 
that well here and there if you do so. Especially with HI-RES textures.
MAYBE I'll make a jonof version, since their was many stuff scraped in this classic 
version (of course you won't miss them :P). But we'll see.

Mama mia, here we go again!!11

title		: Another Big Base Attacked
Filename	: ABBA.map >)
Author		: Maarten v. Oostrum
E-mail adress	: oostrum_maarten@hotmail.com
Misc.Author Info: I'm Dutch, 17 year old, loves music (mostly rock/metal and other stuff).
 		  I still love to creat levels with this build editor but it seems I'm quite
		  lazy or not in the mood to build these days. At least for this map :)
                  		 
Release Date	: 4-4-2005
		  this map was delayed for more then one year.

Other levels	: Maa2 (The big city, not so good)
		  MaaDM2 (MAADM was never released).
		  Maads (Maarten Desert)
		  Toxicity
		  MaaDM: Temple of Death
		  Alien Planet X64-2 (I guess this is my most well-known map).
		  !dm-maa (for dukeweb contest, wasn't really a map tho).
		  And many un-finished and old crap maps which never released :)

		  Maps with other people, where I took a part in:
 		  OGBB (made with William and Merlijn)
		  Supa3 (with Sangluss and Merlijn).
		  CBP2, CBP4 and CBP5 (made with the community :P)
  		 		 			 
Web page	: AMC, DNR and MSDN is fine, no?

Future levels	: We'll see. I've still lots of cool stuff in my mind to build :P
		 
Description 	: New Hi-tech level for u all! :D Theme is a nice cosey base in snow.
		  It's a sort of sequel on X64-2. A whole story happened (read other
		  txt-file for the story, which makes the feeling of the map much better),
		  and a whole story IS going on when you're playing. Those aliens also block
		  your way as much as possible, so they are trying to kill you (how rude!).
                  You'll find lots of info and help via viewscreen(s), and from people who are 
		  talking to you(!). Good luck, it won't be easy!
		  
		  Play tha map and have some fun! :)

Files included	: ABBA.map, ABBA.txt, ABBA-story.txt, dethtoll.mid, bookem03.voc, sohelp02.voc
		  termin01.voc, con03.voc

		  Plz extract *everything*. Those .voc files are a must for the map.  
		  
Mission/plot	: Evil aliens attacked precious base, you have to solve this problem mwuaha :D	
		  
		  *** Plz, read the other txt file 4 tha whole story of the map :) ***

		       No serious bugs anyway, so who cares :P

 design/spriteworks and things like that :) But I didn't rip off.
-Zaxtor for the 3d sprite idea (but I used it in a other way then he did in Alien West Train).
-The cool duke forums (AMC, DNR etc.)+ the rest of the great-mappers and duke-fans out of here.
-The cool bands like System Of A Down, Audioslave, Rammstein, Metallica, Red hot chilli peppers,
 Slipknots last masterpiece CD, called vol. 3, Disturbed etc. I listened to them while I was

* Extra information * (!- = important)

!-WARNING!!!: The map comes with some un expected suprises :) So it's smart to
  play a bit carefull and save often ;-) I'm sure you won't survive it for first time without
  saving the game. In fact it's realistic, you can't just jump and walk around happily like a 
  dancing queen and shoot some alien asses without meeting your Waterloo. :P

!-Following the story (read the viewscreens!), it raises immersion a lot. So read it! :D
 Also another thing: New .voc files are added, plz *ADD* it in ur duke, cuz it's something
 for the map, you'll see (or rather hear) :) 
 And of course, don't forget to read the other txt file with story.

-Yes, you can play coop & DM. DM will take a part by the WSYC-place inside, and outside.
 For the orginal start, is obivous what to do. Recommed to play with 5 people (included you).
 As for coop, it isn't tested, but I guess it should work fine.

-If you want this map harder just play on come get some: the gameplay is alot more "hardcore" 
 gameplay, and it's very fun to play :)
 Oh, and peace of cake is for the tourists/whimps/n00bs/supasangs.

-Comments about this map are welcome, I realy like to know what you think about my work.
