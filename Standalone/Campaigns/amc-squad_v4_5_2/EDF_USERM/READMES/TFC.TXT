             * 3D VISIONS PRESENT: THE FINAL CONFRONTATION v1.0 *
             ****************************************************

Thank you for downloading this Duke Nukem 3D addon!  A lot of time has been
put into the production of it, so we hope that you enjoy it.  It would also
be very nice if you told us your thoughts.

This version features:  7 brand new exciting 1P/MP levels
			1 brand new DM only level
			2 brand new MIDI tracks (level 1 and 6)
			New ending

Watch out, since soon there will be a patch for v1.0 that will add new effects
to the gameplay and possibly also new MIDI!

This patch includes:    Exploding items (Blow up ammo pickups etc.)
                        Ability to kick objects around
                        Alien attack blood that will kill the unaware player
                        Possibly a brand new weapon too!
