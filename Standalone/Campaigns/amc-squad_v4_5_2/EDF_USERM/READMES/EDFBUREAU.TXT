Story                   : Duke meets some aliens, *boom* play dead, hooray!
Description             : Looks like it is the Earth Defence Force's 
                          headquarters: there's a security office, a bunch
                          of desks, a couple of meeting rooms, a server room,
                          and the organization's logo all over the place.
                          Yeah, it has to be. Let's hope they are well-insured.
Levels by this Author   : I'm just going to point out that I designed Needle
                          Time 9 years ago. Holy shit time flies (and I'm still
                          playing video games. Aha, take THAT peer pressure!)
Additional notes        : I tried to focus on the layout so the backtracking
                          feels natural: you get to discover shortcuts to
                          previously visited areas whenever you actually need
                          to get back there. Also, after watching 3D Realms'
                          levels, I noticed the skill level only affects the
                          ennemy forces while the amount of ammos, items, and
                          medkits remains the same. So I made a first run in
                          "Piece of Cake" and put about enough ammo for you to
                          shoot everyone. For "Let's Rock", I added more sneaky
                          ennemies (ready to shoot in dead angles...) and some
                          ammo and medkits in "non-obvious" places. For "Come
                          Get Some", I added extra forces as reinforcement and
                          backups (so you can encounter small packs of ennemies,
                          which is more or less the same ennemy with higher fire
                          power) and added a few more ammos in hidden places. It
                          is still possible to complete the level in "Damn I'm
                          Good" without knowing the map and all of its secret
                          hideouts, but it won't be as easy. In short: ammo and
                          medkits are in same quantity, no matter the skill
                          level (it's the exact opposit of what I did with
                          Needle Time)
Additional Credits to   : Everyone and anyone involved in Duke Nukem 3D. This
                          game's almost twenty, still runs on modern hardware
                          and is still a lot of fun. Thanks everybody!

* Play Information *

Loading                 : Here are the files you need to copy to your Duke
                          directory (you may also put them in a sub directory
                          and load it as a resource in EDuke32)
                          > _EDFBuro.map (the level)
                          > Tiles014.art (extra textures & sprites)
                          > ACC.con (extra objects)

                          ** IMPORTANT **
                          You need to include ACC.CON to GAME.CON, to do that,
                          open GAME.CON and add "include ACC.CON" right after
                          the "include USER.CON" line. Alternatively, you may
                          try to launch the game with "-mx ACC.CON" (works in
                          EDuke32). This level should work with both the Atomic
                          Edition and the original release of Duke Nukem 3D.

Additional notes        : I have no idea why, there were three untagged Sector
                          Effectors hanging around... also fixed the bathroom
                          doors (works fine in EDuke, doesn't in vanilla),
                          opened the level a little bit and added one last pack
                          of shotgun shells. I've spent too much time on this...
