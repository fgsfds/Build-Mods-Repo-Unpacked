Background            : This is my entry for the Resort level contest organised by Matt at Duke
			Nukem Inc - I`d really like to see what the other entries were!
			I thought I`d try something really original, which no-one had tried 				before in order to stand a chance. So drawing inspiration from the hotels 			in Las Vegas, I thought I`d make a hotel with lots of fantasy rooms!

Description	      : Overall, it`s an expensive, lavish hotel, part of the "Voyeur" chain of 			hotels. Yes, it`s managed by the same guy as the one who owns the 				original Voyeur hotel in LA.  But I can guarentee amusement everytime you 			throw open those double doors and enter a new fantasy room!!!  		 


Features	      : An excellent, playable level constructed in Blackjack style.
			"Washington Suite" - re-enact your own scandals!
			"Moonshine Suite" -  Rednecks only.	 
			"007 Suite" - The name`s Bond.
			"Gothic Fetish suite" - No clues on this one!
			"John Wayne Memorial Suite" - Go ahead, make my day!
			Lavishly sculpted gardens
			Private beach
			Tons of bad guys
			Brand new messages - changing the feel of the game somewhat
			New con file
			Loads of Duke Talk
			Hundreds of things to destroy - even things you wouldn`t expect...
			9 Secrets
			Fantastic ending!!!!

Additional Credits To : -3d Realms for the most playable game in existence!! (and yes, I have 				 played Halflife, Quake II and Kingpin) 
                        -Jonah Bishop and his BUILD manuals. I couldn`t have done it without them
			-The Chaingun sound was borrowed from the Vixens demo by Troy Studios. 			 	 Thanks guys!
			   
			
Thankyou:		-Matt and Duke Nukem Inc for organising this contest. You guys should do 			 this more often to attract some of the best level makers around.	
			-2Bad at Crackdown for letting me spare the time to make this!
			-Brian H, if you`re reading this... thanx for the feedback on Brum, 			 	 you`re the only one to reply so far!!! 
			-Deatholl --> Thank you for the support at DMB. Finished Hotelvoy.map 			 	 yet?
			-Airhawke (and Nukeleated) for notifying me of the contest in the first 			 place. I owe ya one. (Any chance of putting this on DMC?!?!)
			-Dukeworld and all it`s hosted sites for keeping the Duke Flame alive.  
			-DDuge - I still regret leaving AVD for Crackdown. How`s the TC going?
			-Pascal Rouaud - Your Roch1, 2 and 3 show me just how to use obscure 			 	 textures to great effect.
			-Bob Averill, you are without doubt the single greatest source of 			 	 amusement in all the Duke Forums. Make some playable levels next time, 			 please. 
			-C3P0 gets a special mention for giving me some moral support during the 			 whole 2 months of construction! I hope your entry turned out OK. 
			-I`d also like to say Hi to all you UK dukers out there, especially 			 Yorick, Clamour and Mortuus.  			
			-Ok, ok, I suppose I must thank you out there, whoever you are, for 				 downloading this, playing it and *hopefully* giving me some feedback. 			 	 It`s the only thing making the job worthwhile, ya know. Thanks again.

=================================================================================================

*Important Information*

Installation           : You`ll need to copy all the files to your main Duke Directory, and click 			 on the Hotelfan Batch file. No need to use SETUP. 

Important Notes        : Get hold of the Crackdown TC as soon as it`s finished!
			 If you don`t have the Voyeur Hotel download that too from DMB - it`s 			 	 just the ultimate in urban combat!
			 And don`t forget - keep playing Duke3d!!!

Tips		       : -Don`t Panic! This may be a fast and furious assault, but you must make 			  use of cover, hide around corners and move in control at all times.
			 -Ammo management is vital. Save your big weapons for the showdown at the 			  end.
			 -Never pick up ammo unless you need it - don`t waste any.
			 -It`s quite easy to shoot off all your rounds before you finish the 			 	  level. There is just enough to complete it, with skill. So make every 			  shot count.
			 -Watch for ambushes.
			 -The fact that Duke can now only carry a sensible amount of equipment 			  	  means it`s very easy to run out of ammo for a weapon before you know 			  	  it.
			 -Above all keep it tight and with practice you can finish.
