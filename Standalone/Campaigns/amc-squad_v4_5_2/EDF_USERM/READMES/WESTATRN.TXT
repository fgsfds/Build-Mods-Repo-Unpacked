Description             : Duke must find an alien semi-organic train that is heading to west and wipe all those
                          aliens before they trash the next city and after duke get off that train and go in a base
                          like somesort of an underground fortress this (Part 2 of this level will be the
                          underground fortress). PS its like that level has 1316 sectors because of sprites trick
                          and intense sector joining


Tips                    :  its a fairly dangerous level so just an easy tip DONT FALL ON THE RAILS OR OFF THE TRAIN
                           also the wagon that are connect together with 2 N like poles with canons be very careful
                           go down slowly the top do like that \_ before the hole so go at the tip and jump
                           or run fast --be careful--
