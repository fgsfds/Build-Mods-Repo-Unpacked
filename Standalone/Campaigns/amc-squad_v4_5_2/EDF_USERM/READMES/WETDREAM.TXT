"After not having released ANYTHING Duke related for about 2,5 years,
I decided to make a come-back with this level. I must say that 
making a tropical map like this in the sun with a laptop is something 
you must be priviledged for, I guess. 

What the name is about? Well, it's a dreamy map with water, what 
else were you expecting from it?

I hope you'll have fun with this new map, and be sure to play 
Tropical Alien Massacre if you have missed it. It's one of my best 
levels ever. Release date: 10-05-2003. God, it already has been 
three years since I released that... So many things have changed!

In case you're wondering where City Terror 2 is, the map is long done. 
It just needs someone who will use all these new funky 3d modeling 
things that has been spawned since late 2003."
