Description           : I've always wanted to make a christmas map for Duke, and DeeperThought's DukePlus was 
			enough to finally kick start my inspiration and get one done. Thanks DT!
	
			Duke has been dropped into some remote snowy mountains to investigate strange alien 
			activity. He will have to treck through the wind caves, a tourist attraction, and then
			an old mining facility before locating the source of the alien activity. Good luck, and
			Good hunting!

			Also, this map was made for Classic mode - don't play it using the HRP.

Additional Credits To : Geoffrey and Sang for Beta testing!

			DeeperThought for making Duke Plus

*Important Information*

Installation           : This level requires Duke Plus to play properly - as of the time of 
			writing this, a download location is:

			http://www.csus.edu/indiv/g/gaskilld/DukePlus.rar

			Download and unzip Duke Plus into an atomic Duke directory first, than
			unzip WCTime.zip into that directory and run the WCTime.bat file.

Important Notes        : This level contains many of DukePlus' features like Night Vision secrets
			 and toughter enemies. If things are getting tough, try using the goggles
			 and looking for dull lights - these will flash brightly when you have the
			 goggles on. Infront of these are hidden items.
