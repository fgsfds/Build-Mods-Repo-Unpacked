// ELYSION TRANSLATOR LOGS

string 2200 ^32Cpl. Torres, EDF BC PANAMA
string 2201 It's been 2 months since we crashed on the ringworld. No sign of
string 2202 any other Terrans so far, just damn monsters. The natives are
string 2203 identical to us, no idea how or why. They're helpful but very
string 2204 cautious. At least we won't starve, but we're preserving ammo
string 2205 and weaponry where possible. No idea if I'll make it home...

string 2206 ^32Cpl. Wyatt, EDF BC PANAMA
string 2207 Don't know if I was lucky to live, or unlucky to come here. The
string 2208 Panama went down when we came near the ringworld; no idea how
string 2209 many lost souls there are out the 6000 or so aboard. We were
string 2210 scattered all around this continent...whilst it has humans
string 2211 here, it also has horrible monsters. Just my damn luck.

string 2212 ^32Sgt. Santiago, EDF BC PANAMA
string 2213 CO Blake set up an FOB at the crashsite and organised us into
string 2214 scouting groups; not sure what he expects us to find. This place
string 2215 is bigger than anything I ever seen before. Don't even know what
string 2216 the hell the mission is; whole thing was classified deep ultra.
string 2217 All I've heard was that we were searching for someone. Here?!

string 2218 ^32Cpl. Petterson, EDF BC PANAMA
string 2219 Spiders jumped me, and stuck me up here. Jokes' on them, I took
string 2220 a hit from one of those damn archers and it's bleeding very
string 2221 badly. If they're hoping for a live meal they're shit out of luck.
string 2222 I hope Torres is alright...Wyatt's a self-centred prick. If by a
string 2223 stroke of luck someone gets this, tell my sisters I love 'em.

// ABYSS TEXT

string 2224 ^32The Translator beeps, hangs for a few tense moments, then
string 2225 ^32spits out an error. The closest language match found was
string 2226 ^32Ancient Sumer. Whatever language the text is in, it's truly
string 2227 ^32Antediluvian in nature...and unmistakably human as well.

// AMC MUSEUM

string 2228 ^32James Stanfield, alongside Jane Ashford and Minerva Armitage
string 2229 Veteran of the Pitfiend invasion back in the 2000s, Stanfield has
string 2230 led a decorated career in the EDF and now is the de-facto leader of
string 2231 the AMC Squad. Courageous, brave, but fairly reckless; his longtime
string 2232 nemesis Magnus Giesler (not pictured) is still at large. James lost
string 2233 his right arm in a classified encounter above Arsia Mons colony.

string 2234 ^32Zaxtor Znort, alongside Skyhv Knawvkiov
string 2235 Zaxtor Znort is a veteran of the Oblivion Wars; he battled
string 2236 an army of Cycloids and eventually defeated Galbaland. When
string 2237 not fighting to save Earth or the rainforests of Madagascar,
string 2238 Zaxtor works alongside his fellow cryptoprocta-ferox people
string 2239 in rebuilding after an asteroid attack by Galbaland.

string 2240 ^32Merlijn Van Oostrum
string 2241 A mysterious knight who appeared in the Netherlands one day with
string 2242 his brother Maarten (not pictured) They defended the country
string 2243 against an attack by a self-proclaimed Necromancer. Noble and
string 2244 just, Merlijn is searching for his lost brother who disappeared a
string 2245 few years ago after the Necromancer's defeat.

string 2246 ^32Highwire, alongside Vladmir Lebedev
string 2247 A former commander for the EDF, Highwire left to spearhead a
string 2248 rebellion against the Empirical Union alongside Lebedev. Smart,
string 2249 crafty and spry for his age, Highwire (real name unknown) is known
string 2250 for his love of old progressive rock music. He worked alongside
string 2251 James as his CO during the pitfiend invasion.

string 2252 ^32Kagura Takahashi
string 2253 A demon hunter from the Akai Kiba Clan, she has vast knowledge
string 2254 of spirits and demons. Her family and clan was devastated
string 2255 and betrayed by her adversary Rikka, a hunter who has complete
string 2256 control over demons. She is tasked with bringing Rikka to trial
string 2257 and is aided by an ancient cursed sword and spirit called Yo.

string 2258 ^32Sangluss
string 2259 A powerful magic user, Sang uses his abilities to defend
string 2260 mankind. Whilst sometimes overly flippant, Sang has worked
string 2261 with the AMC squad and is one of the most valued members.
string 2262 Whilst coming to terms with his abilities, he was trained
string 2263 by the elusive Cair Dore.

string 2264 ^32Rusty Nails
string 2265 A Gunslinger by nature, Rusty has travelled the solar system
string 2266 and battled Cultists for many years. Cool, collected but also
string 2267 ruthless at times, he has battled his nemesis Dr Jekyll around
string 2268 the globe and still hunts the crazed former nazi scientist to
string 2269 this day.

string 2270 ^32Geoffrey
string 2271 An elusive hacker; when asked about his history for this
string 2272 collection, Geoffrey told us that he was related to Royalty
string 2273 and also 10 former US presidents. All we can say is that he
string 2274 likes to keep secrets and harbours an extensive collection
string 2275 of authentic doujinshi.

string 2276 ^32Mikko Sandt
string 2277 Visionary, Entrepreneur, Master of fate - Mikko Sandt is
string 2278 the glorious leader of MS Corp industries. With his self-
string 2279 created wealth due to his revolutionary portal technology,
string 2280 Sandt drags mankind kicking and screaming into a new golden
string 2281 age. ^8Text donated by MS Corp industries

string 2282 ^32Dr Micky Crisp
string 2283 A graduate of the EDF university of 'Stralia, Micky is
string 2284 both an Engineer and also an expert in bio-technology.
string 2285 Reserved and polite, Micky meets any challenge that the world
string 2286 throws at him with wit and ingenuity. Whilst some say he may
string 2287 be a braggart, he has earned his place in the team tenfold.

string 2288 ^32Snowfall
string 2289 Seemingly appearing out of thin air, Snowfall is a kind and
string 2290 courageous space explorer. He brings his knowledge of the
string 2291 solar system to the team and has allowed AMC to extend their
string 2292 reach in protecting Earth. His personal ship, the Snowflake,
string 2293 is capable of FTL travel, a rare feat.

// Lake
string 2300 Here lies Pelinal's trusted companions; Goldsworn the Tower and
string 2301 Ossaem the Temperate. Long did they fight by his side, as his
string 2302 companions and most trusted advisors. Respect their deeds, as
string 2303 you travel on Pelinal's path and his pilgrimage.

string 2304 The sacred waters of the path flow from here into the grotto; 
string 2305 those who are willing to take the plunge of faith will be 
string 2306 rewarded with due progress on their pilgrimage through the 
string 2307 grotto, towards Knight's fall.

// Grotto
string 2308 On his path to Knight's Fall, Pelinal travelled to the Grotto of
string 2309 Jungim the Seamaster, and stood before the throne of the man of
string 2310 the sea. Jungim accepted Pelinal's fealty, and granted entry to
string 2311 the aquaducts, another step on the journey.

string 2312 One must light the torch to be granted an audience with Jungim's
string 2313 throneroom; stand on the plate before the mighty seat of the
string 2314 seamaster to be judged and granted ingress to the aquaducts.

string 2315 ^32Cpl. Winters, EDF BC PANAMA
string 2316 I'm fucked - I've fallen into this cavern and broken my legs. I
string 2317 screamed for help for an hour solid and heard nothing. Don't
string 2318 have any painkillers left...I don't have the balls to end it
string 2319 though. Guess I should say sorry to my parents for ditching
string 2320 them to join the EDF, hopefully Peter will take care of them.

// Sangtemple
string 2400 Finally! After being dormant for so long, finally another
string 2401 lifeform to be tested on. They cried as I made them drink,
string 2402 but eventually some got through the tower trial.
string 2403 After the molten rock, tree root and blood, all that's
string 2404 left to know is that the winds will guide the way.
string 2405 At long last, the treasure of Hero's Hall shall be ours.

// feel free to redact this, I'm just making up some bullshit
string 2410 Beware, for as one may have passed the water trials, a greater
string 2411 trial yet lies before them. The passage to <UNREADABLE> and as
string 2412 the brew requires the molten rock of life, so too shall
string 2413 <UNREADABLE> And as it is written, <UNREADABLE>
string 2414 the Hero's Hall be permissible.

// Sangdragonfight
string 2420 Reading this means the ritual has stopped, most likely due to
string 2421 Naaldir or Axon. If you wish to try your luck meeting him anyway,
string 2422 take Svedr's blade and plant it on the pedestal in the lower
string 2423 mines, then use the elevator platform to ascend to the skycart.
string 2424 You will need to then find the temple of Anchora. God speed.

// ideyr
string 2425 Bring the sacred ashes from the shore to this kiln, to
string 2426 summon the beast from the deep.
