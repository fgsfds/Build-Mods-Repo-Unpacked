/*
 * This .def file controls the new custom game menu selection, as first seen in Ion Fury, which can be fully customized through CON scripts, see NEWGAME_CHOICES.CON
 * Each menu entry can be 'locked' or 'hidden'. Both of these statuses can be toggled on and off through CON.
 * Choices must be defined in sequence. If only choice 0 and 2 are defined, but 1 is not, choice 2 will not appear.
 * 'usercontent' defines a usermap menu entry.
