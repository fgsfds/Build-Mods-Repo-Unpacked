Electric Highways is a game that's all about experience. Everything in this game, 
especially visuals and music, has been created for the purpose of giving the player 
a certain kind of emotion. The setting takes place in a surreal, virtual world, made 
out of abstract 3d graphics, where the player must explore ten levels, each with an 
individual theme.

The year is 2072. Virtual reality has become a worldwide phenomenon, allowing people to 
sink into the virtual web, while experiencing isolation in real life. A VR engineer has 
finished his virtual reality project, but before uploading it on the web, he decides to 
visit it for the last time, plunging deeper into his own surreal world.

The atmosphere of the game has been inspired by early 80's electronic music (including 
such examples as Gary Numan and Depeche Mode), System Shock and the 1984 version of the 
film Metropolis. In some ways, the game is like an interactive conceptual music album, 
where each level is like a short song. The project features a 100% original soundtrack 
inspired by classic electronic music.
