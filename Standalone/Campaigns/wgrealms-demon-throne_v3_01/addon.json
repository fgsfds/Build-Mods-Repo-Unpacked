Most of those monsters have several different versions. Upgrades for weapons and abilities can be purchased throughout the campaign.\r\n\r\nYou can play as 2 different Characters, Duke Nukem or Jedrik.\r\n\r\nYou have been sent to kill the hordes of monsters invading the many Realms of TITAN. Set in 3 different lands, KHUL, ALANISA and THE OLD WORLD. You must end the onslaught and save the realm. The Wizard AXON has summoned you and will share with you his magical powers that can only be increased by killing the demons.\r\n\r\nThe Siege has been lead by the Archonitron and his many lieutenants whom you must defeat to end the war. Only by acquiring enough strength and power will you ever be able to defeat them all.\r\n\r\nFight with kick ass weapons, use magical powers, ally yourself with Immortal beings from far of lands, complete quests, and kill monsters to collect gold and gems.\r\n\r\nWilliam Gee and Dan Gaskill are the minds behind the game, with new and improved art by sebabdukeboss20, Level design by William Gee and Code by Dan Gaskill.",
