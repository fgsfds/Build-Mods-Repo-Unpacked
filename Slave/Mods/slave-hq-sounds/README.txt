====ABOUT=====

This mod replaces original sounds with high quality ones based on actual sources. If a specifc source was not found, then a sound was upscaled.

====HOW TO USE=====

Raze:
	1. Put PowerslaveHQSounds.zip in Autoload folder located in your Raze folder (you might have to create it).
	2. Add PowerslaveHQSounds.zip in your ini file like this:

	[Exhumed.Autoload]
	Path=C:\"YOUR_PATH_TO_RAZE"\Raze\Autoload\PowerslaveHQSounds.zip 

	3. Launch Raze and go to Sound Options -> Advanced Options -> Turn on "Ignore file type  for sound lookup".
	4. Re-run Raze to apply that change.

	Alternatively you can drag and drop PowerslaveHQSounds.zip on Raze.exe
	but 'Ignore file type  for sound lookup' must be turned on as well.

BuildGDX:
	Not supported at the moment :-(

PCExhumed:
