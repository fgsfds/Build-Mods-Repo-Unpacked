Description : My entry for the #RD2021 Map Jam! Although the Map Jam entry
	can be labeled as BETA, as that was the best I could do before the
	deadline. Eversince I figured out how the jank underwater sectors
	work and have fixed them, allowing me to restore and make playable
	both the underwater sectors on the level. So yes, this release is a
	bit better than the contest one.
	
	The Kilmaath plans were	thwarted, however the remaining troops are
	up to no good. You must	venture into the Temple of the Fire and the
	Water and retrieve the ashes of Anubis before they use them for
	their evil deeds.

	This level can be completed in two different ways. The advised way is
	clockwise, as it features a more natural progression. I can perfectly
	be finished counter-clockwise, but it'll be more quirky, because of
	the quirky weapons ;)

* Running the map *

I've included .bat files to run the map under DOS and PCExhumed. PCExhumed will
sport the custom music. Other ports can have the game files on a random folder,
so a .bat file won't do it for many people. However:

-BuildGDX: place the .map file into your PS folder, use in-game the custom
	content menu to select and play the level.
-RAZE: place the .map file into your PS folder, rename it to "lev1" keeping the
	file extension. Run RAZE and start a new game. Remember to revert the
	renaming after playing. For the music you can do the same, renaming the
	ogg file to "exhumed11", keeping the extension.
