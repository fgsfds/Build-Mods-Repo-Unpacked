FORGOTTEN SANCTUARY
-------------------------------------------
a custom level for POWERSLAVE / EXHUMED
by Korbac
-------------------------------------------

This is a user-made level for Exhumed/Powerslave.
I created this with the tools that you can download from the following link:

For reasons unknown to me you can't play this map through DOSBox (or at least I couldn't), so you have to use one of the following sourceports:

BuildGDX (PowerslaveGDX is part of this) - https://m210.duke4.net/ 
PCExhumed - https://pcex.retrohost.net/
RAZE - https://raze.zdoom.org/

Installing for BuildGDX:
Just extract the LEV1.MAP file into a new folder in the Powerslave folder, then start a new game, select user content and navigate to the new folder and select the map.
You can also rename the LEV1.MAP file and put it directly into the main Powerslave folder then choose the renamed level file in the user content menu.
You can also do the same method as described below in the PCExhumed section.

Installing for PCExhumed:
Just extract the LEV1.MAP file into the PCExhumed folder.
If you extracted before the original LEV1.MAP file from the STUFF.DAT into the same directory, I recommend to make a copy of the original file before overwrite it.
Start a new game and the first map is changed to this custom level.
If you want to play the original first level, just delete the LEV1.MAP file.

Installing for RAZE:
Just extract the LEV1.MAP file into the folder where you put STUFF.DAT file (.../[your_RAZE_folder]/data).
If you extracted before the original LEV1.MAP file from the STUFF.DAT into the same directory, I recommend to make a copy of the original file before overwrite it.
Start a new game and the first map is changed to this custom level.
If you want to play the original first level, just delete the LEV1.MAP file.

If you want to play it with correct sector shading (as I intended), I recommend to play it through BuildGDX.

Have a good time!
