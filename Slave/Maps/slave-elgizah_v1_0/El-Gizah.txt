Description           : Medium sized map for a Exhumed/Powerslave
			game. Level features a marsh, desert,
			pyramid, temple and of course the mighty
			Sphinx. I created some tricky puzzles and
			the end is really hard so watch out and may
			the Ra be with you.
Thanks To             : Lobotomy for a great game. But still the
			PC version is much, much worse than far
			superior PSX version. If you run these two
			games at one time then you will
			quickly understand how weak the "Build
			map version 6" was. No slopes, no flying
			3D objects, more time consuming
			spritework, silly "dynamic"
			sector-based lighting, 4096 wall
			limit, slowdowns on open and more detailed
			areas (that might be the result badly
			written executable). But it is still a very
			good game.
