  "description": "Wanton Destruction is an official expansion that was created by Sunstorm Interactive and tested by 3D Realms, but was not released by the distributor. It was found on September 5, 2005 and was released for free.\r\n\r\nThe add-on chronicles Lo Wang's adventures after the original game. He visits his relatives in USA, but is forced to fight off Zilla's forces again. The game culminates with a battle against Master Zilla above the streets of Tokyo, which ends with Master Zilla's death.\r\n\r\nThe game features 12 new levels, new artwork and a few new enemy replacements, such as human enemies; though they still act like their original counterparts."
