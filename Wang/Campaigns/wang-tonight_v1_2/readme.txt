**.  Release Notes
======================================================================
*  Yay, it's true -- it's finally released!!
*  If you have problems launching it, and nothing works, try popping
   the SW CD in.
*  It is best played WITHOUT the SW CD, because we have some custom
   music clips in there.  So, in the game, if you have the SW CD in
   your CD-ROM drive, press "T", and type "cd off".
*  Here are a few known problems:
   - The "Cool Stuff" pages are extremely hard to read.  But they are
     not important enough to delay the production even further, we
     did not fix it.
   - As some of you should know, there is NO sound clip for the final
     cut-scene because we did not have the resources to do one.
     The original one is actually oddly appropriate, but just keep this
     in mind.
   - Yes, framerates do get a little choppy at times, but not very often.
     If you can run the original SW game very smoothly, you should be
     able to run TNE without too much trouble.  The ideal system is Pentium
     133 and up, but P90 should still do.
*  MAKE SURE that you turn 3D-Sprites ON!!  (Unless this gives you problems)
   To do so, in the main menu, go to "Options", and go to "3D Sprites",
   and make sure it is turned "on".  Because we have tons of them!!
*  If you have any further problems, gameplay or otherwise, please go
   to our website, http://www.wangsdojo.com/lightsout, and we'll be glad
   to answer your questions!!
*  Think you're good?  Accept our "Gamer's Challenge"!!  Go to our website
   for more details!!
*  Download the rocking main theme song, by Phillip Winwood, in its full
   MP3 glory at our website!!!
*  PLAY IT LOUD!!

II.  Description
======================================================================
"Tonight Never Ends", from Lights Out, is a whole new episode for Shadow
Warrior.  Lights Out team was originally formed by Jonathan C. Wu in March
in order to gather some of the best builders around the globe to build
one of the most fun-filled episodes for Shadow Warrior.  This episode
consists of five main missions (many including more than one level),
one secret mission, four WangBang levels, and a few other in-between levels.
The Lights Out team poured their hearts and souls into this episode, and we
wish that you will have as much fun playing it as we had making it.

======================================================================
III.  Installation
======================================================================
Simply unzip the Tne.grp and Tne.bat files into your Shadow Warrior
directory and double click the Tne.bat file.
Thats it.

IV.  Play Information

Storyline:

A truly evil man, Zilla, after his humiliating defeat, is lit by vengeance.
He set out to build another empire -- a much stronger, more powerful one.
This time, not just in Japan, but around the world!! He set up secret
facilities and military bases over every major country, guarded by, again,
the creatures summoned from the dark side. Everything is secretive, and
nothing was known about such vast, and deadly empire, until when Zilla
launched a special, brutal, and surprising attack on an English federal
building. The United Kingdom felt increasingly threatened by this mad
Japanese man, and to relieve it of worries and troubles, the obvious solution
seemed to be to call for its best secret agent to destroy this evil empire.
This secret agent is, of course, none other than England's own James Bond,
007.

With access to secretive information around the globe, Lo Wang learned of
such plan of England. He was angered -- very angered, as he had felt
threatened since someone else took his job. A man of honor and pride, Lo Wang
flew to United Kingdom, and found the MI6 control room. He succeeded in
capturing James Bond and locking him up in a cell. "No one takes my job!!"
murmured Lo Wang. He was later delighted by the interesting weapons that
James possesses. Lo Wang knows what he must do -- destroy Zilla's empire
once and for all, with aid from Bond's equipment.

Dressed in James's suit, armed with James's deadly weapons, Lo Wang turned
around, and sneered, "I am Wang, Lo Wang."

======================================================================
Weapons Desctiptions
1.  Katana/Fists -- These are still the good old reliable -- but this
	time, even more powerful than before, so you can take more joy
	out of some slicing!!

2.  Throwing Knives -- No more of those ridiculously weak shurikens!!
	These knives are the real things!!  You throw them 3 at a time,
	and the almost nonexistant reload time makes these very effective
	control tools.  Add to the fact that these sharp knives are very
	powerful, you'll find yourself using this more often then you
	thought!  You can only carry 48 of these at a time now.

3.  Riot Gun -- First the bad news - there's no second fire mode.  You
	can only fire one shot at a time.  Also, you must reload after
	each and every shot.  But now the good news -- each shot is now
	more than 2 times as powerful as the old riot gun!!  You'll find
	the extra firepower more than worth the added reload time.  However,
	you can now only carry 30 shots of these powerful bursts at a time.

4.  MP5 Machinegun -- This gun shoots out a fast and powerful stream of
	bullets that refuse any chance of survival for your opponent.
	Because of is weight, you can only hold one at a time; but the
	added power more than makes up for it.  Plus, no reload!!

5.  Rocket Launcher -- This is exactly the same as before - use the rockets
	when you want some gibs, use the heat seeker when you don't feel
	like aiming, and use the nuke when you don't feel like fighting.
	Very useful, very sweet.

6.  Grenade Launcher -- You won't notice anything different with this gun
	either.  Use this off a ledge or around corners or over walls
	for maximum effect.

7.  Rolling Mines -- HUGE change!!  First of all, the mines will no longer
	stick onto an enemy, so don't try.  These mines roll on the floor
	until they hit a wall.  But they are no longer triggered by
	proximity.  You must trigger them either by shooting it or rolling
	another mine into it.  This weapon is perfect when you have a room
	full of enemies.  All you have to do is appear at the door, roll
	two successive mines into the room, then get the hell out.  Once
	the two mines roll into each other, the room will go boom, and the
	gibs will fly!!  Note that these are a lot more powerful than sticky
	bombs, and have a much bigger blast radius, so use with caution!!
	You can now carry 50 of these at a time.

8.  Rail Gun -- Same as before, line up the enemies and shoot!!

9.  Guardian Head -- This deliciously disgusting weapon has three firing
	modes just like before, with the same strength.

10. Ripper Heart -- squeez the heart and watch your counterpart rip the
	enemies apart!!
