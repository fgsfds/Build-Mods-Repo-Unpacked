2 May 2020

This is the final version of my 3th Ion Fury map, well tested by Sompi severel times.

- made by Leon (SPYmaps) Brinkmann.
- beta tested by Sompi.
- grammar check DwTietz.

many thanks to Oasiz and MBlackwell, and all other Ion Fury development members on Ion Fury Discord server,
as all members of this Discord.

Instructions on how to play the .map file;

- place .map in your Ion Fury main folder, 
- start game, (could be that when you play it on Steam you first need to close Steam all together and open it again. Just like you have to do with any other mod/map.)
- open console through keys (press together);
  Shift + ~
- type in console;
  map spymapsionfury3
- Enter
- close console through keys (press together);
  Shift + ~
- Play and HAVE FUN!!!
  (and don't get killed to much, hahaha).
