One if By Land 	SP,CO-OP 8,GM
                You start at a drop point and Your mission is to get 
                to the Chopper. This map has large open water, a 
                small village, some jungle and a waterfall. for
                the macho player You can try the waterfall, Yes it's
                possible to finish the map in less than 30 seconds, 
                Without cheating, (It took me 40 tries to do it) 

Yer' Toast 	SP,CO-OP 8,GM
                This map started as a Platoon map. On the way back 
                from Your pickup the VC shoot down Your chopper, 
                (Again). You are to get back to theHQ. The main 
                problem is a few hundred VC in the way. This will
                take You through some swamp and some jungle, only 
                to  stumble on a VC Outpost. 
                
In Enemy Land 	SP,CO-OP 4,GM

              	There is a chopper waiting about ten miles up.  Get 
              	back to HQ as fast as posible. We have reason to

		and the Airport.

		Shot down again. Well its only a 25 mile jaunt

                and defend it.

		river edge.  There is a Jeep waiting

		there are a about a 100 VC and a village
		in the way.
