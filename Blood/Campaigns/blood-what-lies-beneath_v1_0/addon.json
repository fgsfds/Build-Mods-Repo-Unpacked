What will he discover beneath the surface, in the bowels of the island? A dark cult has taken over a mansion, its surroundings and the secrets beneath the reef.\r\n\r\nThis is a non-linear addon for Blood. Fight the way you want, choose your own path through the island and find places otherwise kept a secret. Find clues to progress with tomes around the island.\r\n\r\nComes with its own executable due to technical reasons."
