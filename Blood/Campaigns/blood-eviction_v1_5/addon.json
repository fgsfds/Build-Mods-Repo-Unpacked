  "description": "https://www.moddb.com/mods/eviction-addon-for-blood\r\n\r\nEviction is an add-on I have been working on over the past 3-4 years. At this release, it contains 5 highly detailed levels that surpass the original limits of the vanilla game. 4 of which are campaign levels with an additional multiplayer level. It contains five new enemies! Over 35\u002B secrets to be found and dozens of side areas to explore! Randomized keycodes and clues for secrets. Meaning each time you play the code and clue will be unique! Modern effects like patrolling enemies and low gravity!"
