  "description": "https://www.moddb.com/mods/bloodlines-out-of-the-grave-edition\r\n\r\nBloodLines was to be the most ambitious total conversion ever created for Blood. It still is, but it\u0027s far from what was intended. We have admitted that BloodLines will never be fully completed and have decided to release the TC \u0022as is\u0022 with some retouching to make incomplete maps actually playable. I hope you\u0027ll enjoy playing it as much as we have enjoyed making it. Be aware though, that not all maps are what you would expect from a Blood level, it\u0027s not all bloody mayhem. Don\u0027t be disappointed if the TC doesn\u0027t fit your ideas about how a 3d-shooter should be, much of it is about atmosphere rather than action, you will benefit from approaching BloodLines with an open mind. This is the beta version of the first three episodes, including 13 maps, two new enemies and loads of new art and sound"
