***************************************

Part I. Introduction

***************************************

Need a little help? No problem! This is a full walkthrough for Death Wish. You will have to forgive me if the writing sounds a little mechanical - I removed all unnecessary contractions so it would translate more easily. 

I know some people like to find the secrets on their own so I have split this walkthough into 2 parts, the first of which contains no information on locating the secrets and secret levels. Neither of these list the location of the journal Tomes.

Walkthrough A is for people who are a little confused on which direction to travel, need a little guidance, or a couple hints on how best to proceed. Walkthrough A includes sections on the secret levels, but no information on how to reach them. Walkthrough A contains no details in the descriptions of the "transition" levels (the levels that directly follow secret levels and transition back into the main campaign) that will reveal the mission in which the secret levels are located.

Walkthrough B is for those who could use a few secrets (and super secrets) to help them get through a tough level or who just cannot seem to find the secret levels despite their best efforts.

All information in Walkthrough A is included in Walkthrough B. 

** THIS WALKTHROUGH WAS CREATED FOR MEDIUM DIFFICULTY AKA "LIGHTLY BROILED." SOME MONSTER AND ITEM PLACEMENT VARIES WITH CHANGES IN DIFFICULTY **

To clarify:
Cultist = Shotgun Cultist, although "various Cultists" means a mix of the 4 types
Fanatic = Tommy Gun Cultist
Zealot = Tesla Cannon Cultist
Acolytes = TNT/Dynamtie Only Cultist
Butcher = Bloated Butcher aka Fat Zombie

Good luck!

********** EPISODE 1: IN COLD BLOOD **********




<<< E1M1: Home Sweet Home >>>

The first level is expansive with a decent number of enemies so stock up on ammo early. Go around the house collecting all the ammo, including behind the house where some important Flares and other weaponry are placed. When you approach the front gate, a cart with monsters in tow will arrive. Follow the direction from which the cart arrived and cross the bridge. You will come to another longer bridge. If you want some more Shotgun ammo you can run across and grab it, but you will be returning there eventually anyway once you have the Spider Key. To continue, ignore the long bridge for now and go through the dark cave. Continue into the lit areas of the cave until you reach an elevator. Once at the bottom of the elevator, continue forward until you get the Spider Key. Be careful of the Zombies hiding in the darkened areas down there (you may want to use your Beast Vision, acquired at the beginning of the mission). Once you have the Key you will want to backtrack completely out of the cave areas to the original long bridge. Head across the long bridge and grab the Shotgun ammo if you did not earlier. Open the door and blast the Zombies hiding behind the portal. You will fall through the false floor ahead and land in bloody water. What a nasty trick! There are many Gill Beasts here, but if you have skill to take them out without getting seriously wounded, you will find that several of them will drop health and are worth killing. If you are not good with swimming Gill Beasts get out of the water quickly and jump across the pond using the platforms as much as you can. Go through the portal next, taking care to avoid the Gill Beasts that walk through. You will need to kill some Cultists after going to the other side. Make sure to grab the Tesla Cannon the Zealot drops since you will need it for the next battle. Enter the area with your destroyed home and defeat the monsters that appear. It may be wise to use your spare TNT to take out the supplementary monsters so that you can concentrate Tesla fire on the real threat - a Stone Gargoyle. Grab the Key that appears at the top of the house when the Stone Gargoyle dies. Go back where you came from to find that some Zombies have appeared out of the 2nd portal (not the one leading to the blood pond). Enter this portal and use your Key to open the door. Grab the Invisibility cloak and dash up to the Zealot, killing him to obtain the final Key. If you want a Life Leech early on in the episode, wait for your Invisibility to dissipate and defeat the Phantasm. Open the gate with your Key and head outside. Do not worry, you will not have to deal with this many portals ever again!




<<< E1M2: Lost Highway >>>

Lost Highway is a little more straightforward but arguably more dangerous than the first mission. There are several instances where deadly vehicles will drive by so you have to listen out and watch for them, as they can easily kill in one strike. Head out of the forest and cross the road (avoiding the truck) into the woods. There are some hidden Gill Beasts in here so watch out. On the other side of the woods is a tunnel. If you run far enough into the tunnel or kill the 2nd Zombie in the tunnel, a truck will come barreling through, killing everything in its path. You will need to run back into the woods or stay flat up against the rocky wall to avoid it (the truck will not go any further sideways than one of the light posts). Open the gate and make your way across the swampy area to the next road. On this road a deadly car will continuously drive back and forth, so keep your wits about you. This car will kill friend and foe alike so feel free to lure enemies into its path. Hit the switch in the guard tower to rotate the concrete bridge. The room across the bridge is crawling with Cultists who will make short work of you if you dash in. Try luring them outside or toss in a bit of dynamite. There is a barred gate here that is closed. If you have the means, you may want to kill the Hell Hound behind the bars before you raise them. To raise the bars, head up the spiral stairs and hit the switch. Jump into the cart and hit the switch to send it flying down the tunnel. Ignore the explosions - they will not hurt you if you remain in place inside the cart while it is moving. Head up the waterfall and move through the woods until you see a Fanatic. Grab the Tommy Gun ammo the Fanatic drops and continue to the next road. The Cultists have set up a roadblock with boxes and a truck. The Shotgun is impractical here due to their distance, so try using up some spare Flares, Proximity Mines, or TNT if your aim is good. Alternate Flare gun fire works especially well here. There is another Cultist hiding behind the truck, so make sure to kill him by destroying the TNT barrels in his vicinity. Past the little red-lit tunnel a gate will open releasing Hell Hounds. You may want to lay some more Proximity Mines as you will waste a lot of precious gun ammo defeating them, especially at higher difficulties. Do not ignore them if possible, since you will be returning to this area and it will complicate the battle there. After defeating the enemies near the destroyed ramp, head into the small control room at ground level lit up with orange lights, looking out for hidden Cultists along the way. One of the barrels near the control room entrance will explode and release several Choking Hands if you get close, but you can use TNT to destroy them first. After the barrels head to the right of the split and mow down the Fanatics with your Tommy Gun. They are likely to get more shots in on you if you head left instead and allow them to shoot through the glass-covered opening. Get the Key from the Fanatic and hit the switch. Grab the Dagger Key that appears and run out of the control room immediately before the door closes. Outside, new forces have arrived, and you will need to get through them to reach the guard tower near the road block. Hit the switch at the top of the tower to raise the final bridge. Head across the bridge to the next mission.




<<< E1M3: Firebelly >>>

This is probably the easiest level in the first episode, although it does contain a tricky area where you will have to watch your step. Move through the tunnel and go outside. Go down the walkway alongside the water until you reach the next tunnel. Walk forward until the Hell Hound sees you, then drop some Proximity Mines to weaken it before you start firing shells or bullets. Continue with a long-range weapon in hand to fight the enemies on the far side of the bridge. Watch out for the Cultist to the right hiding behind the guard tower. Head up the dark passage, kill the Cultist warming his hands by the fire, and continue to the house. The right side of the house has some ammo in a box you will want to grab. On the far side of the house is a stone pillar that requires the Fire Key. Ignore it for now, and head to the roof for the Skull Key. Get the Key and head inside the house. A Cultist is hiding in there so be careful. Open the door, go down the steps, and hop in the water. Once you emerge from the water you will find that you have been transported to another dimension hidden in the house, where lava is flowing freely (this is the tricky part). The lava will kill you instantly so watch where you jump. As you move along you will see the Fire Key on your right. Jump up to grab it, then immediately continue ahead or duck down in the nearby boat to avoid the fireballs. Jump through the lava fall and you will be able to see the portal back to the original house. There is a Hell Hound hiding around the corner which you will need to vanquish to obtain a Life Essence. Ahead  is the Return Portal, blocked by the Dagger Gate. Head into the Lava Temple behind the gate. The doors to the left lead back outside where a blue light orbits a glowing orb. Follow the path of the orbiting light, which is following an invisible path that you can walk upon. Take the Spider key and go back to the Lava Temple lobby. Go through the other set of doors and blow up the nearby wall. Enter through the hole and continue along the path until you eventually reach the Dagger Key. After adding it to your inventory go back to the Dagger Gate and step through the Return Portal, which will take you back to the icy house. Go through the door on the right. Some Cultists are waiting for you in the middle of the next hallway, so come around the corner with your gun blazing or throw some explosives ahead of you. Continue down the hall and into the arena. If you have a Life Leech you may want to use it is alternate fire here to help thin the crowd. Save your Shotgun ammo for the Spiders, as they will not take much damage from TNT or fire. This is a great place to use spare Proximity Mines if you normally cannot find a use for them. When you have killed enough the spectators will explode and you will be able to head to The Abyss.




<<< E1M4: The Abyss >>>

The Abyss is the most difficult map so far this episode. The layout is split up into 3 floors, with floor 1 being the most difficult. If you can make it to floor 2 then you should be able to relax. Jump into the water and swim ahead. When you pop out of the water in the next area you will see the entrance leading to the Abyss. Tchernobog is ahead, and will give you some important information. Hop through the hole up ahead and drop down into floor 1. 

Go down the stairs until you reach the building with windows. This is the church, and it is the most difficult area in the mission so go slowly. Go around to the side of the building and shoot the Cultist through the window. There is a Fanatic in there, too, so you may want to toss in some explosives. Once inside, go into the first door on the right which leads to the supply room. Grab all the items inside, including the first of 3 Tomes that will reveal the Eye Key. The next door leads to the nave and chancel of the church. The church nave is full of enemies, and there is no one right way to handle it. You may want to alert them to your presence with some gunfire, then exit back outside the door. Use the door as a bottleneck and fight them one at a time. If you run in there is a good chance they will just blast you from all sides. Grab the 2nd Tome sitting on the pulpit to the right of the cross. There is a passageway near the pipe organ leading to an area with a Life Essence. Grabbing it will summon Zombies so only do so if you need health more than ammo. This also leads to the the back entrance of the church's 2nd area. Go through here (watch out for the painting that a Choking Hand jumps through) and kill the Choking Hands that run towards you. Straight ahead is the doorway from the front entrance. On the sides of the hallway are 2 rooms. One has a bookcase and some Cultists. The other room has a Fanatic and the final Tome. Grab the Tome and the stained glass window behind the cross will shatter. The area behind the broken window has the Eye Key. Grab the Key (which summons a Phantasm) and head out of the church completely to get back to the giant staircase. Whew! The rest of the mission should be smooth sailing. Head to the bottom of the stairs and ride the elevator down. Hop through the hole and you will be on floor 2. 

Go out the door and kill the Cultist who is carrying a Diving Suit. Dive into the bloody river and fight the 2 Gill Beasts. Swim in the direction they came from until you reach a new area. Above the surface you will see Tchernobog waiting. Get near him and he will transform into a cluster of Spiders. Hop back into the river where the Spiders will follow you to their doom. Keep swimming until you see a small opening with bubbles around it. Get out of the river here and continue until you get the Key. Return to where Tchernobog transformed. Go through the door and head down to floor 3. Get an explosive weapon ready. As soon as you open the door Zombies will flood the room, and there is no space to jump over them. Kill enough of them and a rock wall will open. Three colored lights will lead to 3 passageways. Follow the blue light and enter the door to make your way to the next mission.




<<< E1M5: Jigsaw >>>

Jigsaw is good for recouping if you took a beating in The Abyss as long as you handle it with equal care. This mission basically has 2 parts. Part 1, the trap house, is where you begin. 

The Trap House
Go down the steps and look left. Go to the door where Tchernobog exited and open it with a Shotgun in hand. A Phantasm will burst out, and you will want to kill it as it will be a big nuisance later on. Continue through the door and go right to another door. Head down the dank hallway and hit the switch at the end, which will fill up the toilet on the other side of the wall. Go to the toilet and grab the Skull Key. You will hear a shattering noise, which is a compartment on the white wall of the main area breaking open revealing several Choking Hands. Kill the Choking Hands and hit the switch near the bathtub. The bathtub will fill with blood, which will drain the vat of blood located on the opposite side of the wall. Go to the vat and hop down. Crawl through the passage and hit the switch. The white wall where the Choking Hands appeared will now start moving backward, opening up a new area. Go to the new area and grab the Key behind the white wall. Head to the safe, open it and grab the final trap house Key, and exit through the giant, sliding metal door. Use a Flare if you have one on the Cultist outside and head around to the back of the building. You will come to a set of stairs leading to a control room. Use an explosive to clear the control room of a hiding Fanatic and hit the switch inside. Look out the window and you will see a door opening. There are some TNT barrels down there that will kill most of the enemies, so you may want to try firing some explosives down there rather than getting into a prolonger firefight with bullets and shells. Head through the new opening until you reach the bomb room. You will need to hit all 4 switches and grab the Key, escaping before time runs out. When time dissipates the bomb will explode, killing anything in the room (the explosions will go no further than the room). 

The Cavern
Thus begins the cavern, which comprises part 2 of the mission. There are several ways to tackle this open-ended section, but this is the most simple. Move forward and kill the Gill Beast to your right. When you approach the bridge Tchernobog will destroy it with explosions, so do not try to run across. Go down the passage whence the Gill Beast came until you come to the open waterfall area. Continue up the earthen stairway until you reach the area with some Spiderwebs. There is a small hole on the right with some ammo inside. You may move through the passage and jump over to where Tchernobog was standing earlier. If the bridge has not blown up yet it will when you get close, so watch out. Move past the eye door to the big Spiderweb. Near the big Spiderweb there is a hole containing several Spiders and a Guns Akimbo with Shotgun ammo. You can grab this at any time since this area of the mission is always available from this point, but you may want to do it now. Head around the curve and jump into the Spider nest. When you grab the Key at the end, 9 Spiders will appear to defend the nest, including a Mother Spider who will make more. If you still have Guns Akimbo, try using alternate fire Shotgun blasts to knock the Mother Spider off a ledge to her doom. You do not have to kill any of them, so if you are low on ammo and high on health try running through them. Return to the eye door and kill the 2 Cultists standing right behind it. Enter the door straight ahead and grab the Flares located outside. Return indoors and go right. The dangling body will burst with Spiders if you get close, so blow it up beforehand. Grab the Dagger Key at the end of the passage and leave the eye door area. On the left of the wall where the Spider nest is located you need to raise the platform so you can cross and use the Dagger Key. Once through the dagger door, you can head right to continue to the next mission. If you want a Life Leech (and a challenge), head to the door straight ahead. Grab the Life Leech at the end of the passage. When you come back around the corner you will find the hallway flooded with about 20 Zombies. You will need explosives to get yourself out of this one, especially on high difficulties. The ceiling is too low for you to jump over them. Once they are cleared you can continue to the next mission.




<<< E1M6: What Lies Beneath >>>

What Lies Beneath gives you a lot of freedom of movement, then slowly takes it away as the level progresses. It is a nice break from some of the previous, more complicated levels. As you come through the opening doors, unload some long-range ammo on the Cultists before they ride close enough to fire on you. There are 2 Hell Hounds running around this outside area, too, the closest of which carries a Life Essence. Run up to the facility and fight your way into the guard tower where you will find a bunch of Tommy Gun ammo and a Key. Enter the main building. If you want to get the drop on the 2 Fanatics inside, enter from the far side of the building. There is a dog cage with a corpse that will burst with Choking Hands if you get too close, so toss TNT in there first. Enter the only open door, kill the Cultist by the radio equipment, and grab the Key. Outside the door, Zombies have filled the hallway. Open the door and toss an explosive, then mow down whoever remains. Go to the medical lab at the end of the hall. Grab the Key (watch out for the Choking Hand), the Tesla Cannon, and the Medical Kit from the metal medical supply closet. Exit the lab and kill the new Zombies. Go through the dagger door and head underground to the saucer. Step into the light and you will appear inside the ship. Open the door (many Choking Hands are inside) and get the Key. Watch out for the Gill Beast that appears in the saucer and head back out. Return to the main hallway in the building and go through the last remaining door. You will head underground again. There is some ammo to the left by the barrels and Spiders to the right. Go past the Spiders and clear out the passage and the boiler room. There is a Hell Hound hiding at the far end of the boiler room so be careful. Grab the Key and hit the switch on the boiler. The boiler will overheat and explode very soon so run past the rising Zombies and get back to the upper floor via the stairs. When the explosions have stopped, run through the opening they have created in the wall underground and continue through the dark. Defeat all the creatures in the flashing red area (and there are quite a few - save ammo for the Mother Spider), and be sure to stand away from the pillar of flesh when you kill the Mother Spider since explosions will go off. Drop into the hole behind the flesh pillar and fall into the water. Climb out onto the concrete and go up the stairs to the end of the mission.




<<< E1M7: Urban Decay >>>

This is a big one. Urban Decay has a lot of different challenges to conquer and it will put your skills to the test. Jump up on the wall and walk along the ledge to the area with the truck. Kill the Cultist and the truck will move forward allowing you to get the Key on the ground behind it. Go back to where you started. Ignore the stairs and head into the apartment building. Tchernobog will transform into a large brood of Rats if you get close, so toss some TNT his way. Go into the first apartment with red carpeting and watch out for the Zombie behind the door. Get the health in the kitchen if you need it (you will be returning to this apartment) as well as ammo and armor from the bedroom closet. Kill the Zombie hiding in the bathroom and a wall will open up in the bedroom, letting you pass into the blue apartment. There are a slew of Zombies beyond the bedroom door so be ready. Kill the Butcher in the kitchen for the Key and head back out of the apartment building (watch out for the Phantasm that appears in the red apartment after killing the butcher). Go up the stairs and kill the Fanatic in the elevator booth. Hit the switch and bring the elevator down, which will be carrying 2 Cultists. Ride back up and get ready to run and gun. The dynamite throwing Cultist behind the first Fanatic that stands in front of the elevator will likely kill you if you do not run out and get him first. Take your time and clear out the office slowly - there are Cultists hidden in some of the cubicles. Get the Fire Key from a butcher in the women's bathroom. The other bathroom has a Flare gun. Enter the manager's office and immediately blast him with gunfire before he can get a shot off. Break the large window in his personal office and jump to the closest rooftop straight ahead. This is a very tricky jump, and any misstep will send you plummeting to your death. Once outside, navigate over to the window of another apartment building and break in. A Gargoyle will break into the bedroom so you may want your Tesla Cannon handy. Jump out the window of the bathroom (where a Zombie is hiding) onto a rooftop. Look at the blinking green finance sign and turn left - you will see an office you will be visiting later with some baddies in it. You can try to take them out early by breaking the window furthest to the left and tossing some explosives up there. Look at the blinking green finance sign and turn right - you will see the finance building and an entrance. 

Jump down to the financial building and ride the elevator to the ground floor. Head over to the exit sign and go left. There is some ammo in the first bathroom. The dark bathroom has a Medical Kit if you need it, but 2 Phantasms will appear as soon as you pick it up. Activate the elevator at the end of the hall, which is full of Zombies. A Spray Can or Proximity Mines may be useful here. Ride the elevator up and kill the Cultists if you did not earlier. Get the Key in the last cubicle. A green kamikaze Cultist is now blocking the elevator. If you shoot or get near him he will blow up the entire floor and the next rooftop, so only do it if you are fast. Take the same route as before back down to the ground floor of the finance building. Zombies will break through the exit doors when you approach. Head out into the parking lot and get ready for a big fight. Go to the top of the gate tower and grab the Key. Several Zealots will appear so hurry back down to the ground before they box you in. Get back inside the building and go left. Bring the elevator down (it has a butcher and a Hell Hound) and ride up to the end of the mission. 




<<< E1M8: Vertigo >>>

The first boss level! Vertigo is short but difficult. Kill the Cultist at the top of the elevator. Zombies will start breaking out of their statues, but if you have explosives you can kill them before they break out. After a certain amount of time has passed the doors to the next area will open. When you step in the doors will slam shut and you will have to battle multiple Hell Hounds in a very tight space. When they have perished a doorway will appear. Head to the rooftops. There are a bunch of enemies up here, but you will want to kill the Stone Gargoyle to end the episode.




<<< E1M9: Spooky World (Secret Level) >>>

Nice job - you found the secret level! Spooky World is very large and there is a ton of fun stuff to do. Start by running up the stairs into the ticket line area. Both ticket booths have some ammo so be sure to go into those. Fight your way to Spooky World's crossroads with the spinning hologram. The snack stands both have good items, so be sure to grab them all. Straight ahead is the entrance to the final section, but you will need all 4 of the Keys placed around the park first. The order in which you obtain them is irrelavant. Each attraction has 1 Key.

Pandemonium Shadow Show:
Head down the hallway and keep going straight until you get the ammo following the other entrance to the theater. Grab the Fire Key on the stage and mow down the enemies. They will be a little hard to see. Just make sure you take out the Acolytes first. Move along the wall until you find your way out. Walk down the long hallway. The gate will come down and allow you to return to the ticket sales area.

Miskatonic Station:
You will have to break the vent in the scream burger stand to reach this area. Walk toward the bridges but wait for the train to pass by first if you do not want to get creamed. You will find the Spider Key on the upper floor of the gift shop.

Happy-Go-PuKey:
No tricks to this. The Eye Key is on the furthest platform. If you fall in, avoid the Gill Beasts and use the stairs near the waterfall. Enemies will appear at the top of the stairs after you grab the Key.

River Ride of Terror:
Kill everyone in the line for the ride - it will make your return much easier (especially if you accidentally fall in the water). Get in the river boat and hit the switch. Prepare for several enemies who will fire on the boat as it moves. Grab the Key and hit the switch to move the boat back to the beginning.

Now that you have all the Keys, head to the entrance to the final section: The House of Horrors. Kill the Fanatics and activate the 4 switches. There is a small army behind the gate that drops so ready your explosives. Run through the forest with the Gargoyles and you will come to the lines for the House of Horrors. Fight your way into the attraction (Flare gun fire works well here) and press on the door to descend. There is a Guns Akimbo on top of one of the wooden shelves you may want to get before clicking on the door. At the bottom you will have to mow down some Zombies and several Cultists in the room that follows which contains the ride carts. Head down the hallway and watch out for the Phantasm who bursts through the window. In the next area just run up the ramp. Keep moving along the ride's metal railway until you reach the blue ballroom. Grab the Key in the middle of the room and fight off the horde that appears. This is a good place to use alternate fire Life Leech if you can. The curtains will eventually rise allowing you to move on. Go to the ramp leading upwards and watch out for the Hell Hound around the corner. Continue through the rest of the ride and you will end up back at the ride's seating area with the carts. Go through the Moon door and destroy the wall near the clock. Go through the wall, turn right, duck under the wooden panel, and open the door to complete the mission. 




<<< E1M10: Ring of Fire (Transition Level) >>>

Head down the blue passage and go through the door. Grab the Shotgun and continue through the second door. The hallway that follows is packed with Zombies so get your explosives ready. Keep moving along to the large outdoor space surrounded by flames. There are a lot of Hell Hounds so keep moving. Defeat all the creatures to move on to the next mission.





********** EPISODE 2: Scar Trek **********




<<< E2M1: Armada >>>

The chase is on! Armada is an easy level where enemies cannot follow you great distances due to the arcitecture. Just do not fall onto the sand speeding by! Stay still while the cart is in motion then hop onto the vessel (which I will refer to as "ships") when the cart stops. This is Ship A. Go through the door to the right and clear the area. Go through the door straight across from the one you used to enter Ship A and wait for the trailing ship to arrive. When it does the gate will come down and Zombies will run out. If you are slick you can bomb a few of them with TNT before the ship arrives. Once a few have died the main cabin will open up allowing you to get the Skull Key. Go back into Ship A and take the door on the left. Activate the cannon and return to the trailing ship. The ship that you fired on will have come close enough to enter. Grab the Eye Key from inside and go back to where you first hopped off your original cart. Walk across the chain connectors to the mini ship. Ignore the cannon and move to Ship B. You will see a switch that will lower the back rim. Press it and return to the mini ship. Rotate the cannon using your Eye Key FIRST, then fire the cannon to make a path into Ship B. You can not blow up the wall before activating the cannon. Clear the inside of Ship B. The door to exit Ship B will open when you get near it, and there are many Zombies waiting for a chance to get inside. Use explosives here to conserve ammo or draw them inside and dodge them. Move straight across the chains to the head of the caravan. Hop in the little cart and drive over to the giant Ship C. There are a few ways to clear this ship but I will just mention the simplest. Starting from where you entered, go to the first door on the left. Head down the hallway and kill the butcher in the bathroom for the Fire Key. Return. Starting from where you entered, go to the door on the right. Clear the navigation room and grab the Spider Key. Return. Starting from where you entered, go to the furthest door to the left. When you run down the walkway a Fanatic will come along on your right and start firing. Unload a Shotgun blast on him and move forward. Go through the door ahead and take out the baddies. As soon as you access the Spider Key locked panel the wall to the left will shoot up revealing several enemies. You will have to act fast to avoid the TNT being thrown. Exit through the rear door of Ship C and fire the giant cannon to end the mission.




<<< E2M2: Out to Launch >>>

You have made a real mess this time. Out to Launch is not too difficult and there are several different ways to go about the mission. Move until you can see the wrecked ship with Tchernobog peeking out. Go right and grab the Key inside the ship buried in sand. Go back and head straight through the destroyed ship to the next outdoor area. Use the Key to unlock the cannon on the mini ship ahead. While the cannon rotates, fire it to destroy the wall blocking the path of the rocket cart. Once the wall is destroyed, activate the rocket cart to send it careening down the channel. The ensuing explosion should wipe out the wealth of enemies in the passage, as well as destroy a wall near the end. Jump over the broken section of wall and you will come to an open area with stairs and a green, toxic pool. You can ignore the butchers for now - you will be back to enter the garage behind them. Go up the stairs and hit the switch in the garage access room to open the garage door. Looking out the window, you will see a band of Zombies have been released. Since there are so many you may want to employ explosives or your Spray Can. Enter the garage. There is some ammo inside the canister carrier. Go through the door and open the gate leading to the elevator. Head up and you will find yourself in the space center. Note the colored lines on the floor as they correspond to the labels listed on the wall. You can tackle the space center in a number of ways, but this is a pretty systematic method. Head to the first door on the left (Supply Room 1). Grab the ammo and hop into the vent, which will lead to Supply Room B. When you exit Supply Room B there will be enemies on you immediate left, so fire away. Head to the control room. Clear out the enemies and grab the Eye Key. Take the space center elevator out in the hallway to the launch bay at ground level or just jump out the control room window (you will take some damage). Go past the rocket to the little building beneath the rocks. Grab the Fire Key in the building and open the fire panel to get a Tommy Gun. Press the eye switch to unlock the rocket clamps. Press the switches on the 2 rocket clamps to move them back in preparation for launch. Return to the space center control room and hit the switch to open the shuttle doors. Follow the red line on the floor to the shuttle (you may need some Flares to get down the hallway in one piece). Drop down the ladder and quickly dispatch the Zealot. Move along until you get to the elevator. Kill the Cultist riding it and hop in. It will rise back up on its own. Hit the switch and you will be on your way to the heavens!




<<< E2M3: Mothership >>>

Mothership will be your first challenging mission in the episode. There are a lot of tight spaces and traps so stay on guard. Head out of the shuttle into the ship bay. Ride the elevator up and go to the control panel to open shuttle 2. Break the canister next to the controls for some shells. When shuttle 2 opens grab the Key inside and return to the upper area to open the gateway out of the ship bay. You will enter the operations hub, or "OPS," and there are a number of ways to go from here. The following method will make sure you are always stocked up with supplies. Go to the armory, grab what you can carry, ignore the other door, and head back to OPS. It will be crawling with monsters so ready any explosives you have available. They will pour of out of the open door so make sure you do not blow yourself up. Clear OPS and go to the cargo bay. In the cargo bay you will need to jump on the boxes to reach the vent furthest from the entrance. Hop in and keep going until you end up in the room with the swinging chains. If you have a couple of Proximity Mines, lay them at the entrance to the vent - some Spiders will get splattered when they try to ambush you. Get the Key and fight off the monsters. There are even more in the vent so make sure you have the Shotgun or Tommy Gun ready. Return to OPS. Head towards the crew quarters. Kill the Gargoyles in the hallway and go to the next door. Continue through the door to the rotating hub, which we will call Spin Hub. Enter the door marked CREW. Grab the Key and wait for the foes to break out of the sleep pods (the door you came through will be locked until they all appear). You can lay Remote or Proximity Mines on the pods ahead of time to get them as soon as they appear. Return to Spin Hub. Enter the door marked POD. You will see the space pod. A Fanatic is waiting in there. This room connects to the armory so if you need to restock do it now. Get in the space pod and hit the switch to send it floating around the mothership to the mini ship bay. Once the pod door opens hop out before it explodes. Destroy the corpse sitting on the floor, grab the Key, and head straight back to Spin Hub. Enter the door marked CORE. Some Choking Hands will drop from a ceiling grate so look out. You will enter a room full of machinery. Ahead to the right on the walkway there is a Zealot, so watch out. Head into the darkened core control room. Hit the 3 switches in order from left to right. Instructions on how to escape the self destruct sequence will be displayed. Push the 2 white pillars and grab the Key. When you do, the self destruct will begin. Immediately run to Spin Hub. Do not worry if you cannot get in right away because walls are blocking the path, you will have some spare time before the explosions catch up. Hurry into the door marked POD and head to the armory straight ahead. Quickly grab anything you missed and head to OPS. Take a right towards the ship bay and use your Key to open shuttle 3. Go into shuttle 3 and hit the switch to end the mission before the explosions catch up.




<<< E2M4: Weird Science >>>

Weird Science centers around a large castle with many places to travel. Unlike Mothership you will have plenty of space to move around so make the best of it when confronted with a lot of enemies. Jump from your ship into the sea. Swim to the right of the cliff where Tchernobog waits and kill the Cultist in the boat. A Gill Beast will be summoned while you are making you are way over to the boat so be ready. Swim to the dock and lure the Hell Hound near the Flare gun into the water. Grab the supplies and Diving Suit then head up to the top of the cliff on the big lift. Grab the ammo by the corpse and walk towards Tchernobog. He will throw some evil powers your way before disappearing. Defeat all the enemies, keeping in mind that the doors to the castle will eventually open releasing various Cultists so you may want to stay back. Enter the castle and you will be in an area we will call the statue hall. If you destroy the hand statue a Life Seed will appear, but so will 4 Phantasms, so choose wisely. Jump in the water to get the Fire Key. Get out of the water an go up to the fire door. This will open up the walkway to the right and the ghost hall straight ahead. Ignore the ghost hall and head along the newly opened walkway to the stairs. Continue to the library where you will find some Beast Vision goggles. When you pick them up a hidden entrance will appear to the dungeon. Head down the spiral stairs, eliminating the Acolytes on your way. At the bottom of the stairs you need to kill the Hell Hounds quickly. Use Tesla ammo if you have it. Enter the earthen, cobwebbed area to get the Key to the torture chamber. Go to the torture chamber. You can avoid fighting the enemies in there if you wish. Go up the staircase to the balcony. Grab the Skull Key and fall into the water. Climb out before the Gill Beasts can hurt you. Before entering the hall you may want to shoot out some of the windows from outside and throw some TNT into the dining room - it is full of enemies. Enter the rear entrance to the ghost hall. Do not get near the ghost in the hall or a Phantasm will appear. The door to the right has some Spirit Armor, which you will want to grab. The doors on the left lead to the dining room. Mow down the Cultists to the left to obtain the Eye Key. Head back out the fire doors toward the statue hall and go left, ignoring the skull switch near a torch. Open the gate with the Eye Key and go up the ramps. If you have one, you will probably want to lay down the alternate fire Life Leech in the statue hall so it can begin attacking a Stone Gargoyle that will appear after you get the Moon Key. Continue to the lightning tower and grab the Moon Key at the summit. Head back to the skull switch near the torch and go downstairs. Enter the lab and get the health on the table. The exit to the mission is around the corner past the transporter.




<<< E2M5: The Grapes of Wraith >>>

You will have more open space to work with in this mission, so make sure you have some flare ammo for those long range battles. Move forward and clear out the red chapel area. There are several Fanatics and Cultists in the chapel so beware. In the next room you will see the Skull door on the left and exits to the right and straight ahead. Go right and kill the Cultist outside. Keep going past the dark hallway back outside and you will find the Skull Key. Use it to open the Skull Door, being careful not to get sliced by the Phantasm waiting just beyond. The next room has a forklift. Use the switch on it to move the lift toward the window, then use the lift as a stepladder to reach the window ledge. Go outside the window and through the silo to a large outdoor area with some blue lights. You will need a Flare Gun or a Voodoo Doll to tackle all the enemies in this area efficiently without incurring damage. Grab the Eye Key from the Zealot and return to the upper walkway alongside the forklift area. Proceed through the door, the Eye Door, and a second Eye Door at the end of the outdoor area's upper walkway. Shoot the barrel in the storage room and it will blow open a passage to the next section. 

To the left are some enemies and a moss-covered temple. You will be going to the right through a cavelike area first. At the end of the cave will be a break in the wall that gives access to a sewage tunnel. Head into the sewage (with a powerful weapon handy for the Gill Beasts) and you will come to a break in the ceiling. Emerge from the opening and you will find yourself in the vineyard. Some enemies will be coming down the slope to attack you so be ready with your long range weapons or take cover in the sewage until they are close enough to fire upon with short range ammo. At the top of the hill is the winery. The Dagger Key is on the long tasting table on the inside-left, but you will have to plow through some serious resistance before you can reach it safely. Now that you have the Dagger Key, return to the mossy temple and enter it. Head right out of the entrance area into the orange-lit room. Turn left and press on the lion slab to lower it. Descend to the bottom of the shaft to the next orange room. Proceed to the green water pool and grab the Fire Key. Return to the main entrance and head up the opposite passageway with the stairs. Use the Fire Key on the switch at the top of the stairs to open the stone gateway across the wooden bridge. Return to the main entrance and cross the bridge. Open the doors past the gateway and continue to the end of the mission. 




<<< E2M6: Deep-Sixed >>>

This mission will be more tough and tricky than the last so make sure you tread carefully whenever entering a new area. You will come to a large structure resembling an open mouth. Hit the switch inside to open the doorway to the cellar directly behind it. From the cellar entrance there are several paths leading to the location of 5 Black Chests that you will need to open the large pink door. Here are the locations:

* This task can be done out of order *
1. Face the pink door. Head left and go forward until you reach a room with a large bonfire in the center. A chest is on a nearby cart.

2. Face the pink door. Head left and go up a nearby slanted ramp, then take the first left into a room with 3 skylights. The chest is near the table. When you grab it Zombies will emerge from 3 passages.

3. Face the pink door. Head left and take the first right. Go straight until the pathway curves and you come to a room with a floating head orbited by bodies. The chest is on the far end of the room. Make sure you have explosives before attempting this room, as you will have to fight off a Zombie swarm.

4. Face the pink door. Head right through the furthest passage (with the stairway). Enter the room at the end of the walkway and grab the chest inside.

5. Face the pink door. Head right through the closest passage (with the boat). Ride the boat to the little island and grab the chest. Be careful Ñ enemies appear when you take the chest. Ride the boat back from whence you came.

Return to the pink door and walk up to it. If you have all 5 Black Chests it will open, releasing a horde of rats. Jump in the pool of water behind them and swim to the next area.

When you get outside, you will see a ghost ship, a few houses, and a lighthouse with a flashing beacon. Go to the boat dock. Enter the ghost ship through an opening adjacent to the center mast. Once inside, face the green hanging cloth. Head left and enter the upturned dining room, which is filled with enemies around every turn, rather than going to the 2nd floor. Grab the Eye Key from the back corner of the room and head to floor 2. In this bedroom you must kill the Phantasm. This will open a passage at the bed's headboard, allowing you to enter the sunken ship. Enter the water and go to the opposite end of the boat (the kitchen) where you will find the Skull Key behind a panel requiring the Eye Key for access. Backtrack to exit the sunken ship and the ghost ship. Go to the lighthouse and take the Skull elevator to the top. Grab the Moon Key and go back down. Use the Moon Key on the other elevator, which will carry you down to the end of the mission.




<<< E2M7: Paradise Lost >>>

Paradise Lost is going to be the most challenging map you have come across in this episode. There is a lot of scenery look at but make sure you keep your eyes out for enemies, too. Walk out of the cave and continue through the crystal cavern. You will come to the entrance of a stone fortification where light is flooding out. We will refer to this as the "fort." There is some water you will be heading into flowing under the fort, and if you have some spare ammo dive down there now and take out the Gill Beasts behind the bars. Enter the fort and clear out the enemies. You may need to draw them out of the fort into the blue area to get some space. Drawing the Hell Hounds out into the water is also useful if you are low on ammo. Go to the space behind the brown glass window and use the "water gate" switch. This opens the underwater bars. Go back out to the blue area, swim past the bars, emerge on the other side to grab the Eye Key, then return to the fort's main area. Go down the hall and open the eye door. There is a Zealot on the other side so be ready to fire. Go up the steps and travel until you see Tchernobog. When you get close a band of Zombies are going to crawl out of the ground. Alt fire Spray Can works wonders here. Eventually a wall behind the Zombies will lower allowing you to continue along a ledge to the backside of the fort. Be careful not to fall off. Get the Dagger Key and open the nearby gate. Return to the first floor of the the fort and go in the other door. A Choking Hand will pop out of a little vase so be careful. Ahead Tchernobog will appear again. What a pest! Get close and he will turn into several enemies. Do not run ahead because there are more foes beyond this point by a locked gate. This little section is deceptively difficult so do not rush. You may even need to run out of the door you came in through after the first batch of baddies is summoned to get some space. Open the gate with your Dagger Key and run into the cave ahead. There is a corpse outside that drops Guns Akimbo. Hop in the cave pool and quickly swim straight ahead until you see the surface of the water. Do not let the Gill Beast along the way slow you down too much. When you emerge on the other side you will be able to see the shore to the right. Past the shore is a large area with lots of enemies and lots of room to maneuver yourself. The altar in the center has a vital Voodoo Doll. Kill the enemies who surround the Stone Gargoyle then use your Voodoo Doll to chip away at his health. Alt fire Life Leech is also useful in this battle. When the Stone Gargoyle perishes a new entrance to the fort will open on the far side of the battleground. Let your Life Leech do most of the work here if you have already laid it down. Otherwise, alt fire Flare Pistol is effective. Go through the new opening, grab the Spider Key, and head back to the main floor of the fort. Zombies are going to be EVERYWHERE after this sequence, so feel free to drop a few Proximity Mines at the Spider doorway as you go through. Navigate through the supply room and take the Moon Key. You will need to go back through the Dagger Key gate from earlier to get to the Moon door, but there is a small Zombie army waiting for you. Dodge as many as you can and hurry through the door. You may need your Shotgun to get the Gargoyle out of the way quickly so you do not get trapped. Jump down the hole in the ground and you will land in some water. Walk towards the light. Tchernobog will launch some fireballs at you so do not run up too fast. Keep walking into the light to end the mission.   




<<< E2M8: The Black Tower >>>

The Black Tower is really going to put you to the test. It is very large and will take more skill to survive than was necessary in Paradise Lost. Walk out of the cave and go left. Grab the weaponry and head through the rest of the forest. Watch out for the Zealot around the corner. When you emerge from the trees you will be able to see the black tower and the battleground that lies before it. There are 2 battalions out here: One in the center that will engage you immediately and a second that will approach when you get closer to the tower. Also in the center is Tchernobog, who will summon a batch of Zombies when you get close enough to the tower. There are a lot of ways to get through this, and it really depends on how much and what kind of firepower you are packing. Napalm fire, alt fire Flare Pistol, and alt fire Life Leech are great if you can spare it. Save your Tesla ammo for the tower entrance. If you are low on supplies make use of all your Proximity Mines and TNT from long range. You are not going to be able to quickly get inside the tower so do not try running past everyone - they will catch up eventually. At the mouth of the tower (literally) there will be some fire pods and more Zombies when you get close. Draw the pod's fireballs so they land on the Zombies if you can, then kill the pods. When you step into the center of the mouth a wall will open releasing Cerberus and some hounds. Unload your Tesla Cannon on Cerberus. If you run out of ammo, keep moving backward while firing - you will have lots of space. You can try blowing Cerberus off the cliff to his death but it is pretty tough to do. Once he's dead you will be able to enter the tower. Go around the corner and step into the glowing light. You will be transported to the tree gallery. Each tree acts as a portal to a unique area. In each area you will need to hit a skull shaped switch. The order in which you activate them is irrelevant. Once you hit all 5 you will be able to use the floor portal in the main gallery area to exit back to the tower interior. Go to the new area that has opened up and drop down the hole to the right into sub level 1 of the tower. 

Go into the next room and pick up the Tesla Cannon on the ground. Proceed across the  invisible bridge, dodging (by hopping through) Tchernobog's fireball rings. Cross to the other side and head down the ramps in the lava filled area to tower sub level 2. Journey across sub level 2's invisible bridge to the doorway with magma falls on each side. There is a Stone Gargoyle flying up above that you will need to kill, but do not get near the Voodoo Doll unless you want to fight the enemies behind the door at the same time. When the Stone Gargoyle is dead grab the Voodoo Doll if you have not already and fight your way into the room with the invisible floor above a magma flow. Move around the ring-shaped hallway and hop into the glowing light. You will be transported outside of the tower where you will have to fight your way back inside. Enter the tower, head right and go up the stairs. Take the elevator up to the tower's top floor. You will see the Fire Key as the path ends. When you grab the Fire Key the area is going to flood with monsters, so you may want to lay around some Proximity or Remote Mines beforehand. Head back to the room with the invisible floor above a magma flow on sub level 3. Enter the fire door, descend to sub level 3, and walk through the magma tunnel. The mission ends shortly after.  




<<< E2M9: Legion >>>

Like Vertigo, this is a short mission. However, you will be doing MUCH more fighting. Any strategies you have for fighting large groups will be needed. Walk into the cave and grab the ammo. Crawl through the rock tunnel and head right at the steps to grab some ammo at the top. The bottom of the stairway will lead to an invisible bridge. When you are  nearly on the bridge Tchernobog's specter will launch some fireballs your way. You will probably want to be away from the back wall when dodging them. Do not run up to Tchernobog - he will explode when you get close. Go to the next room and you will see another specter. This one will summon some Zombies. Attack them and wait for the door on the side to open. The battle begins! You can tackle this any number of ways, so I will just explain the sequence:

Wave A: When you enter 4 Fanatics will appear at the top of the stairs. There is a Guns Akimbo there but you may want to save it. Some other Cultists are hidden behind pillars in the area. Once the last Fanatic has fallen you will trigger Wave B.

Wave B: Tchernobog will summon Acolytes and Zombies everywhere, so do not stand in one place. Eventually a wall will drop releasing more foes and Cerberus, who can be goaded into fighting or killing other enemies. A Zealot who is released alongside Cerberus will drop a Tesla Cannon so be sure to grab it. When Cerberus dies, Wave C begins.

Wave C: You get a few more Zombies before another wall drops, releasing the final set of foes. After you defeat the Stone Gargoyle the episode will end. 




<<< E2M10: Dread Faction (Secret Level) >>>

Dread Faction is a great chance to fill up on some powerful weaponry halfway through the episode as long as you have the quick reflexes to fight off large numbers of Zombies. When the elevator stops, head straight ahead and take the lift up at the end of the sewer. Go around the corner and head into the rock area with a large metal gate. Go left and hit the switch to raise it, then hop into the supply car. Use the control panel by the sleeping Zombie then head to the back where the doors will open exposing the Skull Key. Use it to open the gate on the opposite side of the car to proceed to the food car. Lower the elevator to the left first, bomb the Cultists riding the platform, then open the gate. Grab the Eye Key in the kitchen and be sure to check the fridge for health. Go back down the elevator and head to the dining car through the eye doors. The Fire Key lies behind the next set of double doors past the dining area. Head back to the food car and open the fire door. Grab the Dagger Key and go back to the food car. Continue forward until you open the dagger door and reach a locked door behind 2 Zealots. Climb around the ledge and get atop the head of the train so you can jump down from the roof into the engine room. Once in the engine room, hit the 2 switches and stand back before the train crashes. Move along through the wrecked train and the sewer to the facility rail cart. Ride it to the facility and move into the steam/disinfection room past the Phantasm. Press on the control panel to start the sequence. When you hear the chime a door will open to a large room made up of 4 pathways. At the center is a key panel where you will open up the blue, red, and white sections (in that order as you obtain a key from each area you enter). Zombies are here in enormous numbers, and will return with reinforcements each time you complete a colored section (along with Gill Beasts in some areas). Activate the blue section first with the Dagger Key you obtained earlier.

Blue:
One door leads to some supplies. The next is a small room with some cryo tubes. Hit the switch on the computer panel wall and grab the Moon Key. Return to the key panel and use the Moon Key.

Red:
One door leads to a diving suit. The next is a large room with a large cryo-water tank. Ride the elevator down then press on the computer panel at the end of the walkway. The water level will rise high enough for you to jump in without injury. Swim to the bottom and grab the Spider Key. Return to the key panel and use the Spider Key.

White:
One door leads to some supplies. The next is a small room with some cryo tubes like the blue section. Hit the switch on the wall with the danger sign to open the final pathway behind the key panel. There is a deluge of baddies in there so ready your explosives. 

At the back of the pathway the door is locked, so you will be heading into a vent near the doorway. Crawl through and blast the Zombies. Head down the elevator where you entered the train depot and get ready to take down the final wave of Zombies. Get your Napalm Launcher out for this or you could easily get trapped. Run back to the elevator you came down in the beginning of the mission and hit the switch to bring it to and end.   




<<< E2M11: Behemoth (Transition Level) >>>

Travel down, avoiding the water (it is filled with Gill Beasts). Once you move across the entrance to the building you will have a variety of Cultists and Cerberus on your tail. Blast the Zealots if you need Tesla ammo. Cerberus will drop a Moon Key upon death. Use it to head through the dagger door ahead on the left. The mission ends shortly afterward as you move ahead.




********** EPISODE 3: WAR IS HELL **********




<<< E3M1: Whisper Peak >>>

The final episode begins! Whisper Peak is paced slowly and is not too dangerous or long, but your weapons will be very limited - use them wisely. Head out of the bathroom and journey until you reach the boathouse. Take the boat across the lake and proceed to the town. Walk along the road until you get to the Skull Key sitting next to a radio. Use it to enter the pub and head out the exit door behind the bar. Get the Eye Key and hop on the trash bin. Jump off the bin over the fence and go to the mechanic's shop across from the pub. Open the gate with the Eye Key then head up the stairs. Open the back gate, which will give you access to the rear of the building but also releases a Hell Hound, which is very strong against fire weapons so do not waste flares. Out back you will jump into a well to get the Fire Key, giving you access to the school. Head in and take the first right into a classroom to get some ammo before continuing. Go right at the end of the hall. Outside you will find a Black Chest. Once you touch it, head back inside and down the new hallway. Keep going until you reach the new area with Gill Beasts, or "normal floor." Take the first right into the goo, or "goo floor," then swim straight across to the Dagger Key. Return to normal floor and use the Dagger Key on the switch. Go to goo floor and enter the last doorway on the left (there is a diving suit nearby where the Gill Beast emerged). Hit the switch. There is a Gill Beast who will drop a Life Essence around the corner where the spikes are placed if you have low health and spare ammo. Return to normal floor. Head through the open mouth passage. Continue into the next mouth passage ahead to be whisked away to the end of the mission.         




<<< E3M2: The Room >>>

This one is a little tricky. The Room will have you traveling back and forth from the Room aka the "apartment" and what I will call "subway world," with new sections of subway world unlocking each time you come from the apartment. You will start in the apartment, which resembles an apartment from E1M7. Grab any goodies lying around and go to the front door. Shortly afterward the bathroom door will open up. You will find a hole in the wall. Climb in and you will be transported to subway world. Go left and get inside the ticket booth to open the terminal gate. Now you can get on the track. Do not travel down that track into the darkness to the right or a train going the wrong way will splatter you all over the rails. If you head left you will see a Skull Key. Quickly grab it and run before you get crushed. Open the skull door down where the Zombies are buried next to the track. Descend the stairs, go under the overhead tracks, and up the elevator. Straight ahead through the door you will see a Shotgun. Grab it and kill the Acolytes. Go to the top of the stairs and turn left. Ahead there are some foes who will need to be dispatched. Do not ignore enemies in this mission - you will be revisiting a lot of these areas and your problems will only compound. Head down the ramp to the big terminal. Keep your ears perked for that giant subway car - it can easily demolish you. However, it will kill your enemies just as well, so feel free to lure them into its path. Sometimes the ammo an enemy drops cannot be picked up if the subway performs the kill (engine glitch) so kill them yourself if you need supplies. Get the Eye Key near the gates at the other side of the terminal. Head back to where you killed the Hell Hound and go to the end of the walkway where you will need to get into the ticket booth and use the eye switch. The gate that moves will release a Hell Hound. Past the Hell Hound is a supply closet with a hole leading back to the apartment. This time you will have to attack 3 shadow-like ghosts in the apartment to open up the bathroom. There is one on the couch, one in the kitchen, and one in the bedroom closet. Once the ghosts are gone, go into the bathroom and return through the (now much larger) hole back to subway world. Walk in the rain over to the stairs. Go up and grab the Dagger Key, which will open the gate ahead. Go back to the far side of the big terminal and enter the gateway locked with a dagger switch. Go out the door straight ahead and turn left. The ghost nearby is going to transform into some Gill Beasts so be on guard. Touch the wooden box under the flickering light and turn around. You will see a portal with green rings open up. Go through the portal and you will arrive in the final twisted version of the apartment, which you can finally leave. Watch out for the Zombies just outside the door and head towards the door on the floating platform. Enter into the white light to end the mission. 




<<< E3M3: Shadehaven >>>

There are a lot of places to explore in this mountainside citadel. The number of enemies may be fewer than some of the later missions, but their placement makes the each fight in this mission a little more dangerous than usual. Cross the wooden bridges to Shadehaven's entrance. Hit the switches on each side of the entrance to unlock the front doors. Go inside. We will call this spot (where your back is to the entrance doors and you are facing the inverted cross) "Shadestart." Head to a flashing red elevator on either side of the inverted cross wall and head to the crystal room. Approach the inverted cross from this side of the structure and it will open up, allowing you to reach the Eye Key. Jump to grab it and fall in the golden water pool. Swim straight ahead into the next area through a tunnel and hit the submerged Eye Switch. This will open the portal directly ahead. Enter the portal and grab the Skull Key directly behind you. Jump in the water, grabbing the ammo scattered on the floor, and swim back to the area with the Eye Switch & Portal so you can escape the water. Return to the crystal room and open the Skull Doors. Ride the elevator to Floor 2. Enter the blue hallway on the left and you will end up outdoors. Continue to the yellow stable, watching out for a Hell Hound that is extremely difficult to shoot due to the wooden fence. Go through the wooden door and pick up the Shrink Shroom at the end of the passage. Return to Shadestart. 

Go through the doorway on the right then down the checkered stairs. Straight ahead is a hole in the wall near the floor. When you approach this area with the Shrink Shroom you will be able to access the next area. When you are in the shrunken area, go straight through the opening in the wall. Grab the Fire Key. When you do, a wall will open to a cavern with tiny blue lights. Take the Grow Shroom from the center and exit the hole, after which you will return to normal size. Open the nearby gate with the Fire Switch, then proceed until you reach the Fire Elevator, which will return you to Floor 2 (you can also take the Skull Elevator from earlier). Enter the hall with the neutral colored light. Kill the enemies and hit the Fire Panel, which will unlock the 2 elevators in the room. Go to the far elevator and ride it up. Walk ahead over the metal grating until you get to the Fire Door. Pass through and go up the stairs and into the portal at the end of the hall. Now you are in the inverted hall where you can reach the Dagger Key and a second portal to the left of it. Grab the key and enter the new portal. You will fall into a pool of water by the metal grating. Use your new key to lower the gate outside the pool and reenter the main Floor 2 area. Go left into the Butcher's Dining Hall. Use your key on the Dagger Door in the back and kill the Spiders just beyond inside the 4-way hall. If you go down the left hallway you can pick up some ammo. The door opposite the dining room in the 4-way hall leads to a long passage with flashing red lights. At the end of the hall is the Spider Key. When you take it Phantasms will appear so be ready, especially since the entrance door opens slowly and in most cases you won't be able to simply run past them without taking damage. Return to the main area of Floor 2 and go to the center where the 4 pillars and skylight are located. Hit the 3 Spider Switches and then the skull-faced switch. The floor will rise up, giving you access to the roof. On the roof, proceed to the vessel near the rock wall to find the end of the mission.




<<< E3M4: Bogey Beach >>>

This is the most open-ended map in Death Wish so tackle it as you see fit, luring enemies into the ocean or slaughtering your way right down the boardwalk. This walkthrough will cover the latter. Exit the vessel and the bookstore, then grab the Shotgun and turn right - a vehicle with Cultists will be heading your way. Blast them and break into the little office building. The hallway to the left has the Skull Key (watch out for You-Know-Who's transformation trick). Grab the key and head outside. There is some ammo laying on the beach so get that before you leave the area. Go into the alley next to the office and hit the skull switch, which will open the large gate on the other side of the wall. Go there, and take the ramp onto the boardwalk. To your right is a Gill Beast of whom you should be mindful, and to the left is the main stretch. Down the main stretch, take as many enemies down from afar as you can manage, just as you did at the beginning of The Black Tower. The Fry Shack has some ammo inside. The boardwalk-side entrance to the office is locked so you will have to break through the window to get the Tesla Cannon. The Gameland arcade has some dangerous foes in it so be sure to clear it out. The water ice stand has nothing of value. Go to the open area with the light posts. Grab the Eye Key. When you do, Tchernobog will float away, leaving you to fight some Hell Hounds and Acolytes. Go to the liquor store around the corner and grab the Fire Key inside. Do not run in too hastily or you will get shot up by the fanatics behind the cash registers. Go to the bait shop. The top floor has some Shotgun Shells and a Flare Pistol. The bottom has the key room, which you will need your Eye and Fire Keys to enter. The back of the boat has a shutter you can lower to get a Diving Suit and a Flare Pistol. Go into the key room and take the Dagger Key, which gives you access to the hotel on the other end of the boardwalk. Enter the hotel and continue until you have the Spider Key. Go back where you came from and you will find that the path has changed. Grab the Moon Key at the bottom of the swirling platforms and quickly run back before the Acolytes bomb you off the ledge. Exit the hotel and return to the boat. Press on the boat's cabin door to end the mission.    




<<< E3M5: Duck & Cover >>>

Duck & Cover will be your first big challenge in this episode. There are a lot of firefights with large numbers of foes, and you will have to develop a strategy that works best for you in each situation, as your tactics will vary greatly depending upon whether or not you brought a lot of long-range weaponry into this mission from your previous efforts. Grab the Flare Pistol and wait for the door to get destroyed. Go outside where you will see the fortified shoreline. Swim to shore and kill the Hell Hounds. Head into town for the first big battle. Enter the building with the hole in the side from an air strike. Get the Skull Key, grab the TNT from the area in which the Zombies emerge, and then leave the structure. Go straight ahead past the gates. Do not get near that beeping box - it is a powerful, armed proximity mine! Lure the Zombies lurking nearby to it. Grab the Medical Kit in the phone area then head to the ticket booth for the museum. Get in the booth and use your Skull Key on the switch to unlock the elevator. Ride up. The great hall of the museum is littered with Fanatics. After you kill one of the Cultists at the front desk they will start to scurry around from their hiding places behind the pillars. Kill as many as you can before they split up (a few alt fire Flare Gun shots being ideal). When you get to the big Tchernobog statue take a left into the middle gallery. Doorways on your right and left will lead to the upper and lower galleries. Descend to the lower gallery. In the middle you will see a Tome. Prepare yourself to fight a Zombie horde and take it. Fight your way back upstairs and go to the upper gallery. In the center of the upper gallery the Eye Key is now available. Take it and head back to the statue in the great hall. Go up the stairway (watch out for the hiding, prone-positioned Fanatic) and descend the ramp created by a fallen building. As you go down, you will see some enemies to the right. One drops Guns Akimbo, which you may want for the firefight coming up. At the bottom of the building ramp you will have another battle. Watch out for the hidden Cultists in the alleys between buildings. When the battlefield is clear open the eye door and get the Fire Key. Go back up the ramp, continue through the great hall (watch out for the air strike), and take the elevator back down to the ticket booth area. Turn right and use the Fire Key to enter the brick building. There is Hell Hound right around the corner so toss some explosives ahead of you before entering. Climb up the wreckage and jump atop the slanted ledge of the adjacent building. Near the slanted ledge you will see a window you can jump into. Do so, then take the elevator hidden behind the wall to the bomb shelter. Get the Dagger Key from the back room and escape the bomb shelter before it goes up in smoke. Take the dagger elevator to the top floor. Tchernobog is going to spawn some pests if you get close to be sure to throw an explosive his way. Take the Spider Key and make your way outside the building down to the area near the phone where Zombies are now running around. Use the Spider Key on the radio next to the wall to call in an air strike. The explosion will destroy the wall by the phone, allowing you to reach the minefield. If you get close to one of the gray boxes you will take major (if not lethal) damage, so shoot or explode them ahead of time. You will see a hole in the rock wall across the minefield that you will need to reach. Enter it and you will be on your way to the next mission.   




<<< E3M6: Inferno >>>

Inferno is one of Death Wish's most formidable missions, and it should be â you are nearing the end! You will be doing a lot of traveling and backtracking between a few key locations. The level is made up of 3 sections: 
1. Areas above the fire pit aka "overworld" 
2. the area with all the magma and ruined temples aka "fire pit"
3. Areas below the fire pit aka "underworld"

Overworld & Fire Pit
Run out of the cave and take the long elevator ride down. The water below is shallow so do not take a high dive. Jump in the lake and swim under the waterfall. You will reach a new area with 2 pools (they connect underwater). You may want to hop out from the far pool since you will emerge from the water behind some foes rather than in their sights. Hit the switch at the gate where the Hell Hounds are trapped. If you are low on ammo simply lure them into a water pool. There are 4 Hell Hounds total so make sure one did not run off and hide. Hit the switch in the room by the lift to lower the spikes around it. Shoot the switch in the shaft of the lift to raise the platform (which has 2 Hell Hounds on it). Ride the lift down to fire pit. There are many Cultists and Acolytes to dispose of on the walkway ahead, but most importantly is the Mother Spider. One well placed explosive attack will send her flying into the magma, killing her instantly and saving you a lot of ammunition. I suggest a normal dynamite toss directly in front of her (it may take a few tries to get her airborne). The path ends in a temple structure with several openings and the gateway to underworld (in the center of that giant mouth). We will call this structure "fire hub." There are Fanatics behind all the pillars in here so get ready to fight. On the left side of fire hub you will come to a window. From there you should be able to jump to a broken-up brick walkway. Enter the room at the end of the path and grab the Skull Key off the throne. Return to overworld via the lift, which will be guarded by some newly arrived Acolytes. Go straight ahead to the skull gate. Tchernobog, who stands in your path, will become some gargoyles (who will die like Hell Hounds if you can get them in the water). You may want to lay some Proximity Mines just before the gate entrance - it will help quell a Zombie battalion that arrives shortly. Past the gate there are 2 paths. Either way works well. If you go right kill the Cultist and take the 2nd doorway on the left instead of the first so the walkway Fanatics are not so close when you enter the walkway. The long walkway has 2 Fanatics. There is a small pool along this walkway. Jump in and grab the Eye Key. This will summon a Zombie horde outside the skull gate. Fight through the Zombies and return to fire hub. You are done with the overworld section. From fire hub, go to the room with the throne. On the right side near the magma you will see the eye switch. Use your Eye Key and the nearby platforms will start to move to and fro. The magma will kill you instantly so time your jumps well. Grab the Dagger Key in the room beyond the platforms then return to fire hub. Go to the right side of fire hub and open the dagger gate. Cross the invisible bridge and obtain the Fire Key. You will have to move quickly to avoid getting set ablaze by the Fire Pods nearby. Return to fire hub and use the Fire Key to open the gateway to underworld inside the mouth. Jump in the hole.

Underworld
You will see 2 blue representations of creatures called "specters." You will need to lead a creature of that type to the space. There are 2 ways to go down here. They are mirrors of each other, except one side is used to summon Zombies and the other Gill Beasts. Go to the Gill Beast side. There will be a pack of Cultists and Acolytes at the end of the orange-lit hallway. As you go around the corner past the Phantasm you will see a river of sludge and a statue on the other side. Get near the statue to summon the creature. You will see the summoned creature as you make your way back to the main area with the specters. Lure the creature into the correct specter space and explosions will kill it instantly. Repeat this process on the Zombie side. Once you have completed the task for both sides the mouth wall will open, releasing some Hell Hounds and Cerberus. Inside the mouth there is an elevator down to the temple of flesh, but it will not work until Cerberus is defeated. When he is dead, go down the elevator and go through the wind tunnel. You will be spit out into a vat of goo. When you emerge from the goo, get onto the shore and step into the space with the flickering light. The bone pillars will split, allowing you to go left or right. You will need to hit a switch at the end of each path. Go left and soon you will come to a strange room with a transforming pit. Do not fall in! Trick the Zombies into falling down to their deaths if you wish and hit the skull shaped switch on the opposite side. Return to the flickering light. Go up the right path. You will come to 3 blood pools. Jump in one, then head through the right-side tunnel. Emerge from the blood and head forward through the self-dividing passage to reach the second of the switches. Return to the flickering light, using the blood tunnel on the right as you journey back. The exit from the temple will now be available. Step onto the tongue and the mouth will open, revealing an open area with a boat as well as a few Cultists and Fanatics. They will start firing as soon as the mouth opens so be careful. When you get out to the boat, go underwater to grab the Moon Key. Watch out for any enemies who may have fallen in. When you have the Moon Key, turn the steering wheel on the boat to end the mission.




<<< E3M7: Last Rites >>>

The end is near! This mission is not more difficult than the last if you have enough powerful weaponry, but it does include one big challenge that is really going to test your skills even if you are stocked up on ammo . Grab the Tommy Gun and beware the lightning that will strike a nearby tree. Ahead, the path splits 2 ways. Straight ahead you should be able to see a Napalm Launcher, but it is better to head left for now. Steps will lead to an open area with a small water pool which contains a Life Essence should you require one. Executing an attack on the water pool section properly will take some timing:

By the time you reach the pool of water there will be Cultists coming from the right and the left. Immediately kill the closer ones on the left. Before the ones from the right can reach you, turn around and fire at the TNT Barrels placed by the wall Ñ the resulting explosion should kill several (if not all) of them, saving precious ammo for the real battle ahead. Walk to the area where the Cultists from the right appeared, out near a walkway where you get a view of the clouds far below. Kill the Acolytes and grab the Napalm Launcher. Head back where you came from and go past the water pool to the top of the stairs. There is a Fanatic up here that will drop the Skull Key upon death. Return to the gate in front of the water pool. Open it. When you do, Tchernobog will laugh and explode, spawning Zombies. Behind him is the Hall Gateway. Kill the Zombies the head left around the corner. There are many enemies down this corridor, so be careful. Acolytes are positioned on high ground here, making them more dangerous than usual. You may need to duck down below the fallen pillar for cover. When the area is clear go up to the little building with the bright red floor. Go into the cavelike area, following the red floor until you come to a Wooden Chest. When you pick it up, the Hall Gate will open. Go there and prepare for what is arguably the most difficult battle in Death Wish.

Beyond the gate is the Hall Path, with the Hall Foyer seated at the top of the stairs. When you walk down the path the 4 Chosen will appear Ñ Priests who act like Cultists with high health. When they lose all their health they will transform into Beasts, which are a handful. You will need to kill all 4 of them to progress, and there are several ways about it. Grab the Guns Akimbo if you need it, which will be likely. Using pure firepower to kill them is not recommended, especially on the higher difficulty levels. When they get close you can usually stun them momentarily with a Alternate Shotgun blast before they can use their stomp attack, but since there are so many of them this can be difficult. Your best bet is to knock them off one of the cliffs in the level, either by the Hall Path or where you picked up the Napalm Launcher earlier. I find it is easier to lure the Beasts to the Napalm area and blast them one by one off the walkway as they come around the corner with the Alternate Shotguns Akimbo attack. You may want to convert only a few of them to the Beast stage at a time to avoid getting swarmed. Flares are good for this. You may also want to lay down a Life Leech somewhere if you are going the way of brute force. When all 4 are dead the entrance to the Hall Foyer will open, releasing a slew of baddies. Wipe them out and carefully enter the building, as there are probably a few that did not make it outside. 

Approach the foyer throne. Hit the switch and some Bloated Butchers will be released along with a Mother Spider. Take out the Butchers first with explosives and then take on the Mother Spider. When she dies you will be able to progress past the foyer throne to the Hall of Epiphany. After a confrontation with Tchernobog you will need to enter the Hall of Epiphany and go to the throne room on the far end. Take the Eye Key and return to the boat at the beginning of the mission. When you open the Eye Door, look right. You will see a platform with a ladder next to it. Jump up there to get the Moon Key then return to the throne room in the Hall of Epiphany. Use the key to lower the pillar in the center of the room, which will open the passage to the final mission.



<<< E3M8: Dead End (Final Boss Level) >>>

The grand finale - when you get close to the floating island, hop off and let the battle begin! The stone pillars can be lowered by pressing on them. There is Fire Armor behind the portal. If you break the blue glass in the center of the arena you can get a Life Seed and a VooDoo Doll, but you will have a hard time doing it without taking fire damage from Tchernobog. When you defeat Tchernobog walk into the portal and you will be transported to another dimension where you will have to defeat his spirit form. In this place you will accelerate as you move around unless you are standing on the center platform. If you run out of ammo here you will have to resort to using the Voodoo Doll on Tchernobog, which does little damage but will not deplete your ammo as long as you only use the primary attack. When this form is defeated, step into the portal circle to end Death Wish! 




<<< E3M9: Nightmare (Secret Level) >>>

Nightmare is a strange mission, created with chunks of architecture from episodes 1 & 2. It may also be the most difficult of the secret levels. When you start the mission, you will notice that it resembles E1M1. This impression will not last. Grab the ammo in the downstairs closet. There is a Gill Beast right outside the front door, so have your Shotgun ready. Behind the house, there are 3 Cultists guarding a Black Chest. Touch the chest and return to the front of the house, where you will notice that the environment has opened up. You will see some slanted platforms leading to a doorway you will want to cross through. The Fire Armor sitting on the platform far away is deceptively difficult to reach without falling to your death, so only go for it if you are a jumping expert! Through the door there are 2 Zombies. This is "Firebelly room" aka "HOD room." In the next room,  to the left ("Jigsaw room") there is a Fanatic and a Cultist, the latter of two being right in the doorway. Two Zombies are on the sides of this doorway, just out of sight. If you step into the room, a door will open releasing Rats. Make sure you go into the Rat holding cell to take the Medical Kit. There are Hell Hounds just one the other side of this wall, so do not try to jump through the opening (although you can throw some explosives). Proceed to the next room with the blood-filled boiler/furnace. Wipe out the enemies - you will be returning here. Head outside and go through the window to the apartment bedroom. The closet has some items but grabbing them will summon a Phantasm near the bathroom. Go in the bathroom and head through the hole beside the bathtub. Note the translucent Gill Beast specter. Grab the Skull Key ahead and return to the HOD room. Open the skull door and jump over the white flames to summon some Gill Beasts outside the room. Lead one back to the translucent specter and the adjacent door will open. Carefully hop from one platform to the next until you make you way onto the floating vessel. There is a Life Essence sitting alone on a platform off to the side, but it is much easier to reach that platform than to escape it without falling to your doom. Enter the vessel's rear entryway. When you go out the front entrance of the vessel you will be fired on by several Fanatics. Beyond them lies a twisted chunk of E2M5 aka "paradise room." To the left you will find some flares next to the eye door. Head up the stairs and turn right. You will see a large, dark room. Once you step down into the room go right for the Voodoo Doll, then advance toward the floating stack of ghosts. When you get close they will disappear and release 2 Stone Gargoyles and some Acolytes behind you. When the Stone Gargoyles are dead, a door at the for end of the room (near where the ghosts were) will open, revealing the Eye Key. Grab it and head back to the eye door inside the paradise room. Follow the invisible walkway and you will end up back in the area where you just defeated the Stone Gargoyles, only now a new area directly across from you will be open. There is a small troop of varied Cultists who will begin their assault, so ready your long-range weapon of choice. You will find that this new area is the rear entrance from E2M4. When you approach the floating demon in the distance it will transform into many Gargoyles and Zealots. Defeat as many as you need to continue safely. Inside the castle you will see a white ghost of Caleb. When you get close it will transform into a swarm of Tiny Calebs, so you may want to chuck a dynamite bundle at it. Go left into the cave. Move forward until you reach a giant face in the darkness which will carry you to the next mission. 




<<< E3M10: Morning Gory (Transition Level) >>>

You reawaken in the Low Tide Liquors of Bogey Beach. Grab the ammo in the store and exit. If you exit out via the hole in the wall you can get to a ledge with some Shotgun Shell Boxes. There is a trash can sitting by the side of the arcade. Break up the waste nearby and crawl through the tiny passage to claim some Proximity Mines. Down the boardwalk there is a battalion of Hell Hounds and Cerberus, who will drop a key upon death allowing you to exit the level at the front door to the docked boat. If you need more firepower, grab the Guns Akimbo out of the back of the boat. If you get desperate you can jump into the (now shallow) ocean area to escape a sticky situation.

********** EPISODE 1: IN COLD BLOOD **********




<<< E1M1: Home Sweet Home >>>

Home Sweet Home is expansive with a decent number of enemies so stock up on ammo early. Go around the house collecting all the ammo, including behind the house where some important Flares and other weaponry are placed. When you approach the front gate, a cart with monsters in tow will arrive. Follow the direction from which the cart arrived and cross the bridge. Before crossing, be sure to grab the Basic Armor under the bridge (secret 1). You will come to another longer bridge. If you want some more Shotgun ammo you can run across and grab it, but you will be returning there eventually anyway once you have the Spider Key. To continue, ignore the long bridge for now and go through the dark cave. Continue into the lit areas of the cave until you reach an elevator. If you destroy the wall in the lit cave area before reaching the elevator, you can find a hidden Moon Key out on the ledge which you will need to get the super secret. Once at the bottom of the elevator, continue forward until you get the Spider Key. Be careful of the Zombies hiding in the darkened areas down there (you may want to use your Beast Vision, acquired at the beginning of the mission). Once you have the Key you will want to backtrack completely out of the cave areas to the original long bridge. Head across the long bridge and grab the Shotgun ammo if you did not earlier. Open the door and blast the Zombies hiding behind the portal. You will fall through the false floor ahead and land in bloody water. What a nasty trick! There are many Gill Beasts here, but if you have skill to take them out without getting seriously wounded, you will find that several of them will drop health and are worth killing. If you are not good with swimming Gill Beasts get out of the water quickly and jump across the pond using the platforms as much as you can. Under the water you will find 2 more secrets. Use your Moon Key to get into the Moon door located near the place where you dropped in for some goodies (super secret!). On the opposite side of the underwater area to the right lies a small cave with Body Armor (secret 2). Go through the portal next, taking care to avoid the Gill Beasts that walk through. You will need to kill some Cultists after going to the other side. Make sure to grab the Tesla Cannon the Zealot drops since you will need it for the next battle. Enter the area with your destroyed home and defeat the monsters that appear. It may be wise to use your spare TNT to take out the supplementary monsters so that you can concentrate Tesla fire on the real threat - a Stone Gargoyle. You can also run behind the house and grab a Voodoo Doll (secret 3). If you need more Flares, there are some hidden alongside the flaming cart that greeted you at the beginning of the mission (secret 4). Grab the Key that appears at the top of the house when the Stone Gargoyle dies. Go back where you came from to find that some Zombies have appeared out of the 2nd portal (not the one leading to the blood pond). Enter this portal and use your Key to open the door. Grab the Invisibility cloak and dash up to the Zealot, killing him to obtain the final Key. If you push one of the mounted stone faces in this hallway a passage will open up revealing some ammo (secret 5). If you want a Life Leech early on in the episode, wait for your Invisibility to dissipate and defeat the Phantasm. Open the gate with your Key and head outside. Do not worry, you will not have to deal with this many portals ever again!




<<< E1M2: Lost Highway >>>

Lost Highway is a little more straightforward but arguably more dangerous than the first mission. There are several instances where deadly vehicles will drive by so you have to listen out and watch for them, as they can easily kill in one strike. Head out of the forest and cross the road (avoiding the truck) into the woods. There are some hidden Gill Beasts in here so watch out. On the other side of the woods is a tunnel. If you run far enough into the tunnel or kill the 2nd Zombie in the tunnel, a truck will come barreling through, killing everything in its path. You will need to run back into the woods or stay flat up against the rocky wall to avoid it (the truck will not go any further sideways than one of the light posts). Open the gate and make your way across the swampy area to the next road. If you are low on ammo you will find some more hidden in the swamp area - if you are facing the road from the swamp it will be to the left (secret 1). On this road a deadly car will continuously drive back and forth, so keep your wits about you. This car will kill friend and foe alike so feel free to lure enemies into its path. Hit the switch in the guard tower to rotate the concrete bridge. If you run along the top of the bridge's right wall you will be able to reach a secret area with Reflective Shots on the opposite side (secret 2), which will come in handy in the next room. The room across the bridge is crawling with Cultists who will make short work of you if you dash in. Try luring them outside or toss in a bit of dynamite. There is a barred gate here that is closed. If you have the means, you may want to kill the Hell Hound behind the bars before you raise them. To raise the bars, head up the spiral stairs and hit the switch. Jump into the cart and hit the switch to send it flying down the tunnel. Ignore the explosions - they will not hurt you if you remain in place inside the cart while it is moving. The cleared tunnel contains a small alcove with a Napalm Launcher (secret 3). Head up the waterfall and move through the woods until you see a Fanatic. If you go underwater before heading up the waterfall you will find a secret underwater passage with some Flare Pistol ammo (secret 4). Grab the Tommy Gun ammo the Fanatic drops and continue to the next road. The Cultists have set up a roadblock with boxes and a truck. The Shotgun is impractical here due to their distance, so try using up some spare Flares, Proximity Mines, or TNT if your aim is good. Alternate Flare gun fire works especially well here. There is another Cultist hiding behind the truck, so make sure to kill him by destroying the TNT barrels in his vicinity. Past the little red-lit tunnel a gate will open releasing Hell Hounds. You may want to lay some more Proximity Mines as you will waste a lot of precious gun ammo defeating them, especially at higher difficulties. Do not ignore them if possible, since you will be returning to this area and it will complicate the battle there. Instead of going down the ramp you can actually jump onto the nearby building ledge where the lights are flashing. Jump from this ledge to the roof of the brick building with 2 smoke stacks. At the front of the building is a Napalm Launcher (secret 5). After defeating the enemies near the destroyed ramp, head into the small control room at ground level lit up with orange lights, looking out for hidden Cultists along the way. If you go past the location of the last Cultist before the control room, you will see a ledge the leads around the building to the left. Go out on the ledge to find a stockpile of Proximity and Remote Mines (secret 6). One of the barrels near the control room entrance will explode and release several Choking Hands if you get close, but you can use TNT to destroy them first. After the barrels head to the right of the split and mow down the Fanatics with your Tommy Gun. They are likely to get more shots in on you if you head left instead and allow them to shoot through the glass-covered opening. Get the Key from the Fanatic and hit the switch. Grab the Dagger Key that appears and run out of the control room immediately before the door closes. Outside, new forces have arrived, and you will need to get through them to reach the guard tower near the road block. Hit the switch at the top of the tower to raise the final bridge. Head across the bridge to the next mission.



<<< E1M3: Firebelly >>>

This is probably the easiest level in the first episode, although it does contain a tricky area where you will have to watch your step. Move through the tunnel and go outside. Go down the walkway alongside the water until you reach the next tunnel. Before going in, look right and you will see some concrete slants jutting out from the wall. Use them as stepping stones to reach some hidden items in the rock wall (secret 1). Move forward until the Hell Hound sees you, then drop some Proximity Mines to weaken it before you start firing shells or bullets. Continue with a long-range weapon in hand to fight the enemies on the far side of the bridge. Watch out for the Cultist to the right hiding behind the guard tower. If you head up into the tower you can get your hands on an Invisibility cloak (secret 2), which is useful if you can hurry along to the house and take out the Cultist inside before it wears off. Head up the dark passage, kill the Cultist warming his hands by the fire, and continue to the house. The right side of the house has some ammo in a box you will want to grab. On the far side of the house is a stone pillar that requires the Fire Key. Ignore it for now, and head to the roof for the Skull Key. Get the Key and head inside the house. A Cultist is hiding in there so be careful. Open the door, go down the steps, and hop in the water. While in the water, be sure to press on the wall with the bloody hand stains. A wall will open behind you revealing a Life Leech & ammo (secret 3) which will be very useful at the end of the level. Once you emerge from the water you will find that you have been transported to another dimension hidden in the house, where lava is flowing freely (this is the tricky part). The lava will kill you instantly so watch where you jump. Behind the doorway structure there is small ledge you can jump up to which has a Fire Armor and some health (secret 4). Before you get to the Fire Key there is a small rock tunnel you must go through. Go through it and look left as soon as you move to the next platform. You should be able to see a partially hidden area with a tiny stepping stone leading to it. Make your way to the hidden area and grab the Moon Key, which you will need to get to the secret level. Make sure you do not bump your head on the ceiling when you try to jump back to the stepping stone. As you move along you will see the Fire Key on your right. Jump up to grab it, then immediately continue ahead or duck down in the nearby boat to avoid the fireballs. Jump through the lava fall and you will be able to see the portal back to the original house. There is a Hell Hound hiding around the corner which you will need to vanquish to obtain a Life Essence. Ahead  is the Return Portal, blocked by the Dagger Gate. Head into the Lava Temple behind the gate. The doors to the left lead back outside where a blue light orbits a glowing orb. Follow the path of the orbiting light, which is following an invisible path that you can walk upon. Take the Spider key and go back to the Lava Temple lobby. Go through the other set of doors and blow up the nearby wall. Enter through the hole and continue along the path until you eventually reach the Dagger Key. After adding it to your inventory go back to the Dagger Gate and step through the Return Portal, which will take you back to the icy house. Go to the stone pillar behind the house and use your Fire Key. Cross the platforms that rise and continue into the gated arena building. Go through the door on the right. Some Cultists are waiting for you in the middle of the next hallway, so come around the corner with your gun blazing or throw some explosives ahead of you. There is a weapon training area with two Zombies. Jump onto the walls enclosing the area to reveal not only a Life Seed (secret 5), but also Key 7 sitting out in the middle of the water. You will need this to get to the secret level, so quickly swim across the water avoiding the Gill Beasts. None of them drop items so do not bother fighting. Grab Key 7 and go back over the weapon training wall. Continue down the hall and into the arena. If you have a Life Leech you may want to use it is alternate fire here to help thin the crowd. Save your Shotgun ammo for the Spiders, as they will not take much damage from TNT. This is a great place to use spare Proximity Mines if you normally cannot find a use for them. When you have killed enough the spectators will explode and you will be able to head to The Abyss. Across from the exit there is a gate you can open with the Moon Key. Behind it, a Key 7 door leads to the secret level (E1M9).




<<< E1M4: The Abyss >>>

The Abyss is the most difficult map so far this episode. The layout is split up into 3 floors, with floor 1 being the most difficult. If you can make it to floor 2 then you should be able to relax. Jump into the water and swim ahead. When you pop out of the water in the next area you will see the entrance leading to the Abyss. If you stay underwater and look around you will find a little ice tunnel that leads to a Basic Armor (secret 1). Tchernobog is ahead, and will give you some important information. Hop through the hole up ahead and drop down into floor 1. There is a ledge to the right at the top of the stairs where some blood is flowing down. Jump to the ledge and find the hidden passage with a Napalm Launcher (secret 2). Go down the stairs until you reach the building with windows. This is the church, and it is the most difficult area in the mission so go slowly. Go around to the side of the building and shoot the Cultist through the window. There is a Fanatic in there, too, so you may want to toss in some explosives. Once inside, go into the first door on the right which leads to the supply room. Grab all the items inside, including the first of 3 Tomes that will reveal the Eye Key. The next door leads to the nave and chancel of the church. Across from this door is a stone face in the wall. Shoot it to reveal a secret area with a Tesla Cannon (secret 3). The church nave is full of enemies, and there is no one right way to handle it. You may want to alert them to your presence with some gunfire, then exit back outside the door. Use the door as a bottleneck and fight them one at a time. If you run in there is a good chance they will just blast you from all sides. Grab the 2nd Tome sitting on the pulpit to the right of the cross. Behind the choir seating on the right side of this area is a window. Shoot it out and go onto the outside ledge where a Super Armor waits (secret 4). There is a passageway near the pipe organ leading to an area with a Life Essence. Grabbing it will summon Zombies so only do so if you need health more than ammo. This also leads to the the back entrance of the church's 2nd area. Go through here (watch out for the painting that a Choking Hand jumps through) and kill the Choking Hands that run towards you. Straight ahead is the doorway from the front entrance. On the sides of the hallway are 2 rooms. One has a bookcase and some Cultists. Press on the bookcase near the back wall to reveal a secret bookshelf with a Voodoo Doll (secret 5). The other room has a Fanatic and the final Tome. Grab the Tome and the stained glass window behind the cross will shatter. The area behind the broken window has the Eye Key. Grab the Key (which summons a Phantasm) and head out of the church completely to get back to the giant staircase. Whew! The rest of the mission should be smooth sailing. Head to the bottom of the stairs and ride the elevator down. Hop through the hole and you will be on floor 2. 

Shoot one of the 2 stone wall panels in this room to reveal a small passage leading to Body Armor (secret 6). Go out the main door and kill the Cultist who is carrying a Diving Suit. Dive into the bloody river and fight the 2 Gill Beasts. Swim in the direction they came from until you reach a new area. Above the surface you will see Tchernobog waiting. Get near him and he will transform into a cluster of Spiders. Hop back into the river where the Spiders will follow you to their doom. Keep swimming until you see a small opening with bubbles around it. Get out of the river here and continue until you get the Key. There is a crack in the rocky wall before you reach the room with the keep. Blow up the wall and go through the revealed passage to find some hidden ammo (secret 7). Return to where Tchernobog transformed. Go through the door and head down to floor 3. Get an explosive weapon ready. As soon as you open the door Zombies will flood the room, and there is no space to jump over them. Kill enough of them and a rock wall will open. Three colored lights will lead to 3 passageways. Follow the blue light and enter the door to make your way to the next mission.




<<< E1M5: Jigsaw >>>

Jigsaw is good for recouping if you took a beating in The Abyss as long as you handle it with equal care. This mission basically has 2 parts. Part 1, the trap house, is where you begin. 

The Trap House
Go down the steps and look left. Press the handprint on the wall to reveal a hidden Flare Pistol secret 1). Head across the room and jump over to the area between the safe and the pillar. The side of the safe has a hidden switch that will open a wall near the door where you entered. Go into the passage and grab the Basic Armor (secret 2). Go to the door where Tchernobog exited and open it with a Shotgun in hand. A Phantasm will burst out, and you will want to kill it as it will be a big nuisance later on. Continue through the door and go right to another door. Head down the dank hallway and hit the switch at the end, which will fill up the toilet on the other side of the wall. Go to the toilet and grab the Skull Key. You will hear a shattering noise, which is a compartment on the white wall of the main area breaking open revealing several Choking Hands. Kill the Choking Hands and hit the switch near the bathtub. The bathtub will fill with blood, which will drain the vat of blood located on the opposite side of the wall. Go to the vat and hop down. Crawl through the passage and hit the switch. The white wall where the Choking Hands appeared will now start moving backward, opening up a new area. Go to the new area and grab the Key behind the white wall. Head to the safe, open it and grab the final trap house Key, and exit through the giant, sliding metal door. Use a Flare if you have one on the Cultist outside and head around to the back of the building. When one of the Acolytes dies Zombies will spawn. Jump off a Zombie's head on to the wall across from the building's window, where you will be able to locate some useful Reflective Shots (secret 3). You will come to a set of stairs leading to a control room. To the left of the stairs there is a wall with a bloody handprint. Press the handprint and a wall on the side of the building will open revealing some ammo (secret 4). Use an explosive to clear the control room of a hiding Fanatic and hit the switch inside. Look out the window and you will see a door opening. There are some TNT barrels down there that will kill most of the enemies, so you may want to try firing some explosives down there rather than getting into a prolonger firefight with bullets and shells. Head through the new opening until you reach the bomb room. You will need to hit all 4 switches and grab the Key, escaping before time runs out. When time dissipates the bomb will explode, killing anything in the room (the explosions will go no further than the room). 

The Cavern
There are several ways to tackle this open-ended section, but this is the most simple. Move forward and kill the Gill Beast to your right. When you approach the bridge Tchernobog will destroy it with explosions, so do not try to run across. Go down the passage whence the Gill Beast came until you come to the open waterfall area. If you jump into the water, you will see a passage that leads to the area below the bridge that was destroyed. Go here and look left to find a hidden alcove with Spirit Armor and Tommy Gun ammo (secret 5). There are 2 Gill Beasts and multiple bone eels down in the water so you will have to decide if it is worth the trouble. Continue up the earthen stairway until you reach the area with some Spiderwebs. There is a small hole on the right with some ammo inside. You may move through the passage and jump over to where Tchernobog was standing earlier. Before jumping to Tchernobog's spot, look left and you will see that you can jump to the top of the waterfall. Do this, then go through the falling water into a secret room. Attack the body on the wall and it will leave behind a Life Seed (secret 6). If the bridge has not blown up yet it will when you get close, so watch out. Move past the eye door to the big Spiderweb. Near the big Spiderweb there is a hole containing several Spiders and a Guns Akimbo with Shotgun ammo. You can grab this at any time since this area of the mission is always available from this point, but you may want to do it now. Head around the curve and jump into the Spider nest. When you grab the Key at the end, 9 Spiders will appear to defend the nest, including a Mother Spider who will make more. If you still have Guns Akimbo, try using alternate fire Shotgun blasts to knock the Mother Spider off a ledge to her doom. You do not have to kill any of them, so if you are low on ammo and high on health try running through them. Return to the eye door and kill the 2 Cultists standing right behind it. Enter the door straight ahead and grab the Flares located outside. Return indoors and go right. The dangling body will burst with Spiders if you get close, so blow it up beforehand. Grab the Dagger Key at the end of the passage and leave the eye door area. On the left of the wall where the Spider nest is located you need to raise the platform so you can cross and use the Dagger Key. If you ride the platform back down you will see a walkway leading to a dangerous secret. This secret can easily get you killed so think twice about doing it if you are the kind of player who does not like to save his/her game. You will come to a dark church (secret 7). As soon as you step onto the chancel a large number of deadly foes will appear to punish you. If you are skilled enough you can lure the Zealots into firing their Tesla Cannons at the Stone Gargoyle instead of hitting you. If you make it out alive head back to the platform, raise it, and go through the dagger door. Once through the dagger door, you can head right to continue to the next mission. If you want a Life Leech (and a challenge), head to the door straight ahead. Grab the Life Leech at the end of the passage. When you come back around the corner you will find the hallway flooded with about 20 Zombies. You will need explosives to get yourself out of this one, especially on high difficulties. The ceiling is too low for you to jump over them. Once they are cleared you can continue to the next mission.




<<< E1M6: What Lies Beneath >>>

What Lies Beneath gives you a lot of freedom of movement, then slowly takes it away as the level progresses. It is a nice break from some of the previous, more complicated levels. As you come through the opening doors, unload some long-range ammo on the Cultists before they ride close enough to fire on you. There are 2 Hell Hounds running around this outside area, too, the closest of which carries a Life Essence. Run up to the facility and fight your way into the guard tower where you will find a bunch of Tommy Gun ammo and a Key. If you run around the left side of the main building you will find an ammo cache (secret 1). On the opposite side of the main building is a smaller one, which you can enter to pick up some Basic Armor from the dead body inside (secret 2). Enter the main building. If you want to get the drop on the 2 Fanatics inside, enter from the far side of the building. There is a dog cage with a corpse that will burst with Choking Hands if you get too close, so toss TNT in there first. Enter the only open door, kill the Cultist by the radio equipment, and grab the Key. Press on the bookshelf in this room to get ahold of some Shotgun ammo (secret 3). Outside the door, Zombies have filled the hallway. Open the door and toss an explosive, then mow down whoever remains. Go to the medical lab at the end of the hall. Grab the Key (watch out for the Choking Hand), the Tesla Cannon, and the Medical Kit from the metal medical supply closet. Use explosives the wall with the medical charts and one will reveal a hidden passage to Body Armor (secret 4). Exit the lab and kill the new Zombies. Go through the dagger door and head underground to the saucer. Step into the light and you will appear inside the ship. Open the door (many Choking Hands are inside) and get the Key. Watch out for the Gill Beast that appears in the saucer and head back out. Return to the main hallway in the building and go through the last remaining door. You will head underground again. There is some ammo to the left by the barrels and Spiders to the right. Go past the Spiders and clear out the passage and the boiler room. There is a Hell Hound hiding at the far end of the boiler room so be careful. Hop into the boiler flames to grab a Life Seed (secret 5). Grab the Key and hit the switch on the boiler. The boiler will overheat and explode very soon so run past the rising Zombies and get back to the upper floor via the stairs. When the explosions have stopped, run through the opening they have created in the wall underground and continue through the dark. Defeat all the creatures in the flashing red area (and there are quite a few - save ammo for the Mother Spider), and be sure to stand away from the pillar of flesh when you kill the Mother Spider since explosions will go off. Drop into the hole behind the flesh pillar and fall into the water. Climb out onto the concrete and go up the stairs to the end of the mission.




<<< E1M7: Urban Decay >>>

This is a big one. Urban Decay has a lot of different challenges to conquer and it will put your skills to the test. Jump up on the wall and walk along the ledge to the area with the truck. Kill the Cultist and the truck will move forward allowing you to get the Key on the ground behind it. Go back to where you started. Ignore the stairs and head into the apartment building. Tchernobog will transform into a large brood of Rats if you get close, so toss some TNT his way. Go into the first apartment with red carpeting and watch out for the Zombie behind the door. Get the health in the kitchen if you need it (you will be returning to this apartment) as well as ammo and armor from the bedroom closet. Kill the Zombie hiding in the bathroom and a wall will open up in the bedroom, letting you pass into the blue apartment. There are a slew of Zombies beyond the bedroom door so be ready. Kill the Butcher in the kitchen for the Key and head back out of the apartment building (watch out for the Phantasm that appears in the red apartment after killing the butcher). Go up the stairs and kill the Fanatic in the elevator booth. Hit the switch and bring the elevator down, which will be carrying 2 Cultists. Ride back up and get ready to run and gun. The dynamite throwing Cultist behind the first Fanatic that stands in front of the elevator will likely kill you if you do not run out and get him first. Take your time and clear out the office slowly - there are Cultists hidden in some of the cubicles. Break through the window near the manager's door to get a Super Armor out on the ledge (secret 1). In a cubicle on the other side of the office, a Life Leech is hidden in the corner (secret 2). Get the Fire Key from a butcher in the women's bathroom. The other bathroom has a Flare gun. Enter the manager's office and immediately blast him with gunfire before he can get a shot off. Break the large window in his personal office and jump to the closest rooftop straight ahead. This is a very tricky jump, and any misstep will send you plummeting to your death. Once outside, navigate over to the window of another apartment building and break in. A Gargoyle will break into the bedroom so you may want your Tesla Cannon handy. Jump out the window of the bathroom (where a Zombie is hiding) onto a rooftop. Look at the blinking green finance sign and turn left - you will see an office you will be visiting later with some baddies in it. You can try to take them out early by breaking the window furthest to the left and tossing some explosives up there. Look at the blinking green finance sign and turn right - you will see the finance building and an entrance. 

Jump down to the financial building and ride the elevator to the ground floor. Head over to the exit sign and go left. There is some ammo in the first bathroom. If you press on the bloody handprint inside the bathroom stall, a secret chamber will open up containing some goodies (secret 3). The dark bathroom has a Medical Kit if you need it, but 2 Phantasms will appear as soon as you pick it up. Activate the elevator at the end of the hall, which is full of Zombies. A Spray Can or Proximity Mines may be useful here. Ride the elevator up and kill the Cultists if you did not earlier. Break the first window on the left as you enter this floor and jump outside near the fan, where you will find a Life Seed (secret 4). Get the Key in the last cubicle. A green kamikaze Cultist is now blocking the elevator. If you shoot or get near him he will blow up the entire floor and the next rooftop, so only do it if you are fast. Take the same route as before back down to the ground floor of the finance building. Zombies will break through the exit doors when you approach. Head out into the parking lot and get ready for a big fight. If you come outside and go left along the building, you will come to some metal canisters and a hidden Napalm Launcher (secret 5). Go to the top of the gate tower and grab the Key. Several Zealots will appear so hurry back down to the ground before they box you in. Get back inside the building and go left. Bring the elevator down (it has a butcher and a Hell Hound) and ride up to the end of the mission. If you want the last secret, hop out the window before the end-switch and head down to the area with large wooden crates near a wall. Behind one of them lies a Medkit (secret 6). You will practically have to go back through the whole level after going down there, so only bother if you really need the health.




<<< E1M8: Vertigo >>>

The first boss level! Vertigo is short but difficult. Kill the Cultist at the top of the elevator. If you face the elevator, the snake panel to right can open up to reveal a Life Leech (secret 1). Zombies will start breaking out of their statues, but if you have explosives you can kill them before they break out. After a certain amount of time has passed the doors to the next area will open. When you step in the doors will slam shut and you will have to battle multiple Hell Hounds in a very tight space. When they have perished a doorway will appear. Press the wall adjacent to the doorway to grab a Life Seed behind the fireplace (secret 2). Head to the rooftops. There are a bunch of enemies up here, but you will want to kill the Stone Gargoyle to end the episode. There are some helpful guns behind the bigger buildings if you get a chance to run to them (secrets 3 & 4). 




<<< E1M9: Spooky World (Secret Level) >>>

Nice job - you found the secret level! Spooky World is very large and there is a ton of fun stuff to do. Start by running up the stairs into the ticket line area. Both ticket booths have some ammo so be sure to go into those. Fight your way to Spooky World's crossroads with the spinning hologram. The snack stands both have good items, so be sure to grab them all. Straight ahead is the entrance to the final section, but you will need all 4 of the Keys placed around the park first. The order in which you obtain them is irrelavant. Each attraction has 1 Key.

Pandemonium Shadow Show:
Head down the hallway and keep going straight until you get the ammo following the other entrance to the theater. Grab the Fire Key on the stage and mow down the enemies. They will be a little hard to see. Just make sure you take out the Acolytes first. Move along the wall until you find your way out. Walk down the long hallway. The gate will come down and allow you to return to the ticket sales area.

Miskatonic Station:
You will have to break the vent in the scream burger stand to reach this area. Walk toward the bridges but wait for the train to pass by first if you do not want to get creamed. You will find the Spider Key on the upper floor of the gift shop. If you jump out the window with the missing bars, you will see a Super Armor sitting in the path of the train (secret 1). Wait for the train to pass then run a grab it.

Happy-Go-PuKey:
No tricks to this. The Eye Key is on the furthest platform. If you fall in, avoid the Gill Beasts and use the stairs near the waterfall. Enemies will appear at the top of the stairs after you grab the Key. You can leap from the first platform onto a tattered, wooden wall ledge where you will be able to reach a Life Seed (secret 2).

River Ride of Terror:
Kill everyone in the line for the ride - it will make your return much easier (especially if you accidentally fall in the water). Hop on top of the waterfall next to the big sign and located the Tesla ammo (secret 3). Get in the river boat and hit the switch. Prepare for several enemies who will fire on the boat as it moves. Grab the Key and hit the switch to move the boat back to the beginning. If you go where the Cultists were firing their guns at you, you will discover a hidden Napalm cache (secret 4).

Now that you have all the Keys, head to the entrance to the final section: The House of Horrors. Kill the Fanatics and activate the 4 switches. There is a small army behind the gate that drops so ready your explosives. Run through the forest with the Gargoyles and you will come to the lines for the House of Horrors. Fight your way into the attraction (Flare gun fire works well here) and press on the door to descend. There is a Guns Akimbo on top of one of the wooden shelves you may want to get before clicking on the door. At the bottom you will have to mow down some Zombies and several Cultists in the room that follows which contains the ride carts. Head down the hallway and watch out for the Phantasm who bursts through the window. If you jump through the broken window you will be able to find a hidden Voodoo Doll (secret 5). In the next area just run up the ramp. If you need some health, get to the lowest part of the ramp and fall off onto the lower floor. You will need some health to survive the fall, but you will obtain a Medicine Pouch and a Life Leech around the corner for your trouble (secret 6). Keep moving along the ride's metal railway until you reach the blue ballroom. Grab the Key in the middle of the room and fight off the horde that appears. This is a good place to use alternate fire Life Leech if you can. The curtains will eventually rise allowing you to move on. Go to the ramp leading upwards and watch out for the Hell Hound around the corner. If you walk into the Cerberus display you will find some Napalm ammo behind the false flames (secret 7). Continue through the rest of the ride and you will end up back at the ride's seating area with the carts. Go through the Moon door and destroy the wall near the clock. Go through the wall, turn right, duck under the wooden panel, and open the door to complete the mission. 




<<< E1M10: Ring of Fire (Transition Level) >>>

Head down the blue passage and go through the door. Grab the Shotgun and continue through the second door. The hallway that follows is packed with Zombies so get your explosives ready. If you jump up on the outside area's wall ledge you will be able to grab some Spirit Armor (secret 1). Keep moving along to the large outdoor space surrounded by flames. There are a lot of Hell Hounds so keep moving. Defeat all the creatures to move on to the next mission.




********** EPISODE 2: Scar Trek **********




<<< E2M1: Armada >>>

The chase is on! Armada is an easy level where enemies cannot follow you great distances due to the arcitecture. Just do not fall onto the sand speeding by! Stay still while the cart is in motion then hop onto the vessel (which I will refer to as "ships") when the cart stops. This is Ship A. Go through the door to the right and clear the area. Shoot out the windows and climb onto the outside ledge for some Body Armor (secret 1). Go through the door straight across from the one you used to enter Ship A and wait for the trailing ship to arrive. When it does the gate will come down and Zombies will run out. If you are slick you can bomb a few of them with TNT before the ship arrives. Once a few have died the main cabin will open up allowing you to get the Skull Key. Go back into Ship A and take the door on the left. Activate the cannon and return to the trailing ship. The ship that you fired on will have come close enough to enter. Grab the Eye Key from inside and go back to where you first hopped off your original cart. Walk across the chain connectors to the mini ship. Ignore the cannon and move to Ship B. You will see a switch that will lower the back rim. Press it and return to the mini ship. Rotate the cannon using your Eye Key FIRST, then fire the cannon to make a path into Ship B. You can not blow up the wall before activating the cannon. Clear the inside of Ship B. There is a small switch on the wall of the cannon loading bay where a Acolyte is hiding. Hit it to open up a compartment with Reflective Shots (secret 2). The door to exit Ship B will open when you get near it, and there are many Zombies waiting for a chance to get inside. Use explosives here to conserve ammo or draw them inside and dodge them. Move straight across the chains to the head of the caravan. Hop in the little cart and drive over to the giant Ship C. There are a few ways to clear this ship but I will just mention the simplest. Starting from where you entered, go to the first door on the left. Head down the hallway and kill the butcher in the bathroom for the Fire Key. Return. Starting from where you entered, go to the door on the right. Clear the navigation room and grab the Spider Key. If you hop into the furnace you will be able to get your hands on a Life Seed (secret 3). Return. Starting from where you entered, go to the furthest door to the left. When you run down the walkway a Fanatic will come along on your right and start firing. Unload a Shotgun blast on him and move forward. If you press on the bloody handprint in the walkway area it will open a panel revealing a Napalm Launcher, which could come in handy in the next room (secret 4). Go through the door ahead and take out the baddies. As soon as you access the Spider Key locked panel the wall to the left will shoot up revealing several enemies. You will have to act fast to avoid the TNT being thrown. Exit through the rear door of Ship C and fire the giant cannon to end the mission.




<<< E2M2: Out to Launch >>>

You have made a real mess this time. Out to Launch is not too difficult and there are several different ways to go about the mission. Move until you can see the wrecked ship with Tchernobog peeking out. Go right and grab the Key inside the ship buried in sand. Go back and head straight through the destroyed ship to the next outdoor area. Before leaving the ship, you should look for a window panel that you can crawl through to obtain some Body Armor (secret 1). Use the Key to unlock the cannon on the mini ship ahead. While the cannon rotates, fire it to destroy the wall blocking the path of the rocket cart. Once the wall is destroyed, activate the rocket cart to send it careening down the channel. The ensuing explosion should wipe out the wealth of enemies in the passage, as well as destroy a wall near the end. Jump over the broken section of wall and you will come to an open area with stairs and a green, toxic pool. You can ignore the butchers for now - you will be back to enter the garage behind them. There is a Napalm Launcher on the side of a truck among the waste canisters (secret 2). Go up the stairs and hit the switch in the garage access room to open the garage door. Looking out the window, you will see a band of Zombies have been released. Since there are so many you may want to employ explosives or your Spray Can. Enter the garage. There is some ammo inside the canister carrier. Go through the door and open the gate leading to the elevator. Head up and you will find yourself in the space center. Note the colored lines on the floor as they correspond to the labels listed on the wall. You can tackle the space center in a number of ways, but this is a pretty systematic method. Head to the first door on the left (Supply Room 1). Grab the ammo and hop into the vent, which will lead to Supply Room B. When you exit Supply Room B there will be enemies on you immediate left, so fire away. Supply Room A has a ground-level vent with Reflective Shots if you want to drop into the control room safely (secret 3). Head to the control room. Clear out the enemies and grab the Eye Key. Take the space center elevator out in the hallway to the launch bay at ground level or just jump out the control room window (you will take some damage). Go past the rocket to the little building beneath the rocks. To the right is a wall you can blow up revealing some Gargoyles and a Super Armor (secret 4). Do not worry, the explosions will significantly weaken at least one of them. Grab the Fire Key in the building and open the fire panel to get a Tommy Gun. Press the eye switch to unlock the rocket clamps. Go to the large gate on the left of the space center and hit the switch to lower it. Run up the stairs to the garage control room and open the fire door to get some Tesla supplies (secret 5) then return to the launch bay. Press the switches on the 2 rocket clamps to move them back in preparation for launch. Return to the space center control room and hit the switch to open the shuttle doors. Follow the red line on the floor to the shuttle (you may need some Flares to get down the hallway in one piece). Drop down the ladder and quickly dispatch the Zealot. Move along until you get to the elevator. Kill the Cultist riding it and hop in. It will rise back up on its own. Hit the switch and you will be on your way to the heavens!




<<< E2M3: Mothership >>>

Mothership will be your first challenging mission in the episode. There are a lot of tight spaces and traps so stay on guard. Head out of the shuttle into the ship bay. Ride the elevator up and go to the control panel to open shuttle 2. Break the canister next to the controls for some shells. When shuttle 2 opens grab the Key inside and return to the upper area to open the gateway out of the ship bay. You will enter the operations hub, or "OPS," and there are a number of ways to go from here. The following method will make sure you are always stocked up with supplies. Go to the armory, grab what you can carry, ignore the other door, and head back to OPS. It will be crawling with monsters so ready any explosives you have available. They will pour of out of the open door so make sure you do not blow yourself up. Clear OPS and go to the cargo bay. On the way, there is a vent behind a grate with flashing red lights. Crawl in and you will pick up some goodies (secret 1). In the cargo bay you will need to jump on the boxes to reach the vent furthest from the entrance. Hop in and keep going until you end up in the room with the swinging chains. If you have a couple of Proximity Mines, lay them at the entrance to the vent - some Spiders will get splattered when they try to ambush you. Get the Key and fight off the monsters. There are even more in the vent so make sure you have the Shotgun or Tommy Gun ready. Return to OPS. Head towards the crew quarters. Kill the Gargoyles in the hallway and go to the next door. If you turn around you will see a metal grate above the other door. Fire at it and a secret panel will open with some supplies (secret 2). The corpse in there will burst with Choking Hands so toss some TNT its way. Continue through the door to the rotating hub, which we will call Spin Hub. There is a metal grate covering an opening between POD and CORE. Go in for some ammo and health but do not get crushed by the moving walls (secret 3).  Enter the door marked CREW. Grab the Key and wait for the foes to break out of the sleep pods (the door you came through will be locked until they all appear). You can lay Remote or Proximity Mines on the pods ahead of time to get them as soon as they appear. Face the barred conveyer belt behind the welcome sign. Enter through the broken bars. One direction will lead you to a Life Leech (secret 4) and the other to some sewage water containing a Life Seed (secret 5). Return to Spin Hub. Enter the door marked POD. You will see the space pod. A Fanatic is waiting in there. This room connects to the armory so if you need to restock do it now. The space pod room has a computer panel that opens to reveal a Voodoo Doll (secret 6). Get in the space pod and hit the switch to send it floating around the mothership to the mini ship bay. Once the pod door opens hop out before it explodes. Destroy the corpse sitting on the floor, grab the Key, and head straight back to Spin Hub. Enter the door marked CORE. Some Choking Hands will drop from a ceiling grate so look out. You will enter a room full of machinery. Ahead to the right on the walkway there is a Zealot, so watch out. If you walk behind some of the machinery on the right you will see a flashing switch. Use it to reveal a hidden Napalm cache (secret 7). Head into the darkened core control room. Hit the 3 switches in order from left to right. Instructions on how to escape the self destruct sequence will be displayed. Push the 2 white pillars and grab the Key. When you do, the self destruct will begin. Immediately run to Spin Hub. Do not worry if you cannot get in right away because walls are blocking the path, you will have some spare time before the explosions catch up. Hurry into the door marked POD and head to the armory straight ahead. Quickly grab anything you missed and head to OPS. Take a right towards the ship bay and use your Key to open shuttle 3. Go into shuttle 3 and hit the switch to end the mission before the explosions catch up.




<<< E2M4: Weird Science >>>

Weird Science centers around a large castle with many places to travel. Unlike Mothership you will have plenty of space to move around so make the best of it when confronted with a lot of enemies. Jump from your ship into the sea. Swim to the right of the cliff where Tchernobog waits and kill the Cultist in the boat. A Gill Beast will be summoned while you are making you are way over to the boat so be ready. Swim to the dock and lure the Hell Hound near the Flare gun into the water. Grab the supplies and Diving Suit then head up to the top of the cliff on the big lift. Grab the ammo by the corpse and walk towards Tchernobog. He will throw some evil powers your way before disappearing. Defeat all the enemies, keeping in mind that the doors to the castle will eventually open releasing various Cultists so you may want to stay back. Enter the castle and you will be in an area we will call the statue hall. If you destroy the hand statue a Life Seed will appear, but so will 4 Phantasms, so choose wisely. The high walkway to the right has a broken wall near the fire. Jump inside the fire area and hit the switch to reveal some Body Armor and ammo nearby (secret 1). Jump in the water to get the Fire Key. Use your Diving Suit to swim down the long underwater tunnel. At the end to the right there is a Napalm Launcher and another suit so you can get back without drowning (secret 2). Get out of the water an go up to the fire door. This will open up the walkway to the right and the ghost hall straight ahead. Ignore the ghost hall and head along the newly opened walkway to the stairs. Continue to the library where you will find some Beast Vision goggles. When you pick them up a hidden entrance will appear to the dungeon. Head down the spiral stairs, eliminating the Acolytes on your way. At the opening halfway down the stairs, you should be able to see Tchernobog standing on a ledge. Make the big jump over to him (it may sap some health) to get some secret supplies (secret 3). At the bottom of the stairs you need to kill the Hell Hounds quickly. Use Tesla ammo if you have it. Above the Shotgun ammo there is a stone face. Shoot it to open one of the dungeon cells that contains some ammo (secret 4). Enter the earthen, cobwebbed area to get the Key to the torture chamber. On the opposite side of the area that contains the Key is a grate you can destroy that will allow you to enter a hidden room containing Key 7, which you will need to enter the secret level. Go to the torture chamber. You can avoid fighting the enemies in there if you wish. Go up the staircase to the balcony. If you turn left you will find a switch that requires the Moon Key - you will be returning here later to access the secret level. Grab the Skull Key and fall into the water. Climb out before the Gill Beasts can hurt you. Before entering the hall you may want to shoot out some of the windows from outside and throw some TNT into the dining room - it is full of enemies. Enter the rear entrance to the ghost hall. Do not get near the ghost in the hall or a Phantasm will appear. The door to the right has some Spirit Armor, which you will want to grab. The doors on the left lead to the dining room. Mow down the Cultists to the left to obtain the Eye Key. On the right there is a metal saucer behind some hanging bodies. Blow up the saucer to reveal some ammo and items (secret 5). If you plan to grab the Invisibility, you may want to access secret 6 first so you do not waste time. Head back out the fire doors toward the statue hall and go left, ignoring the skull switch near a torch. Open the gate with the Eye Key and go up the ramps. At the bottom of the ramps there is a breakable stone decoration that will reveal a passage to the gated area. In the gated area, gib the hanging body to get a Life Leech (secret 6). You will probably want to lay down the alternate fire Life Leech in the statue hall so it can begin attacking a Stone Gargoyle that will appear after you get the Moon Key. Continue to the lightning tower and grab the Moon Key at the summit. Head back to the skull switch near the torch and go downstairs. Enter the lab and get the health on the table. The exit to the mission is around the corner past the transporter. If you want to get to the secret level, ignore the lab and head back to the balcony past the torture chamber. Use the Moon Key on the switch up there to lower the pillars placed in the water area. Jump across the tops of the pillars until you come to a secret entrance. There are 2 Hell Hounds just inside the entrance so be sure to bomb them ahead of time or just fall back in the water if you catch on fire fighting them with bullets or shells. Proceed to the elevator and use Key 7 to enter the secret level (E2M8).




<<< E2M5: The Grapes of Wraith >>>

You will have more open space to work with in this mission, so make sure you have some flare ammo for those long range battles. Move forward and clear out the red chapel area. There are several Fanatics and Cultists in the chapel so beware. In the next room you will see the Skull door on the left and exits to the right and straight ahead. Go right and kill the Cultist outside. Behind one of the pillars in this area (facing out toward the rain) you will see a switch. Press it to reveal some hidden Body Armor (secret 1). Keep going past the dark hallway back outside and you will find the Skull Key. Use it to open the Skull Door, being careful not to get sliced by the Phantasm waiting just beyond. The next room has a forklift. Use the switch on it to move the lift toward the window, then use the lift as a stepladder to reach the window ledge. From here you can jump onto a nearby barrel shelf to get some Flare ammo, crucial for the fight up ahead (secret 2). Go outside the window and through the silo to a large outdoor area with some blue lights. You will need a Flare Gun or a Voodoo Doll to tackle all the enemies in this area efficiently without incurring damage. Grab the Eye Key from the Zealot and return to the upper walkway alongside the forklift area. Proceed through the door, the Eye Door, and a second Eye Door at the end of the outdoor area's upper walkway. Shoot the barrel in the storage room and it will blow open a passage to the next section. 

To the left are some enemies and a moss-covered temple. You will be going to the right through a cavelike area first. At the end of the cave will be a break in the wall that gives access to a sewage tunnel. Jump over the sewage to the upper platform to get some Basic Armor and a Napalm Launcher, which will make the next part of the mission easier (secret 3). Head into the sewage (with a powerful weapon handy for the Gill Beasts) and you will come to a break in the ceiling. Emerge from the opening and you will find yourself in the vineyard. Some enemies will be coming down the slope to attack you so be ready with your long range weapons or take cover in the sewage until they are close enough to fire upon with short range ammo. At the top of the hill is the winery. Before you go in, jump on the barrel near the rock wall to find some Reflective Shots sitting over the ledge (secret 4). The Dagger Key is on the long tasting table on the inside-left, but you will have to plow through some serious resistance before you can reach it safely. On the opposite side of the winery from the tasting table (to the right of a large window) there is a hidden switch up on the ledge. Hit it to reveal some explosive ammo and Spirit Armor (secret 5). Now that you have the Dagger Key, return to the mossy temple and enter it. Head right out of the entrance area into the orange-lit room. Turn left and press on the lion slab to lower it. Descend to the bottom of the shaft to the next orange room. If you press on the lion slab right ahead in the lower room you will reveal a hidden Tesla Cannon (secret 6). Proceed to the green water pool and grab the Fire Key. Return to the main entrance and head up the opposite passageway with the stairs. If you jump across the green water to the dirt hill and look on the right, you will see a switch on the white stone wall. Press it to obtain some Tommy Gun & Tesla ammo (secret 7). Use the Fire Key on the switch at the top of the stairs to open the stone gateway across the wooden bridge. Return to the main entrance and cross the bridge. While crossing, look behind you toward the ceiling. You will see a stone face that you can shoot to reveal a hidden Life Seed (secret 8). After obtaining it you may need to jump into the green water pool to return to the main entrance. Open the doors past the gateway and continue to the end of the mission. 




<<< E2M6: Deep-Sixed >>>

This mission will be more tough and tricky than the last so make sure you tread carefully whenever entering a new area. There's a secret right near the beginning of the hallway where 2 Zombies are located. Break the potted plant near the wall and you will see a gray switch behind it. Use it to open a door in the stone wall, giving you access to Body Armor (secret 1). You will come to a large structure resembling an open mouth. Hit the switch inside to open the doorway to the cellar directly behind it. Near the skylight of the cellar's central pillar is a hidden switch. Shoot it to open the middle pillar which hides a Life Leech (secret 2). From the cellar entrance there are several paths leading to the location of 5 Black Chests that you will need to open the large pink door. Here are the locations:

* This task can be done out of order *
1. Face the pink door. Head left and go forward until you reach a room with a large bonfire in the center. A chest is on a nearby cart.

2. Face the pink door. Head left and go up a nearby slanted ramp, then take the first left into a room with 3 skylights. The chest is near the table. When you grab it Zombies will emerge from 3 passages. Enter the center passage and press on the wooden wall to reveal an Invisibility Cloak (secret 3).

3. Face the pink door. Head left and take the first right. Go straight until the pathway curves and you come to a room with a floating head orbited by bodies. The chest is on the far end of the room. Make sure you have explosives before attempting this room, as you will have to fight off a Zombie swarm.

4. Face the pink door. Head right through the furthest passage (with the stairway). Enter the room at the end of the walkway and grab the chest inside.

5. Face the pink door. Head right through the closest passage (with the boat). If you look at the rock wall to the right you will see a crack in the wall. Bomb it to reveal a Tesla Cannon (secret 4). If you go underwater near the place where the boat rests you will see a tunnel leading to a Life Seed (secret 5). Ride the boat to the little island and grab the chest. Be careful Ñ enemies appear when you take the chest. If you continue past the island into the water, you will see an underwater cave on your left, which holds a Napalm Launcher and Gasoline (secret 6). Ride the boat back from whence you came.

Return to the pink door and walk up to it. If you have all 5 Black Chests it will open, releasing a horde of rats. Jump in the pool of water behind them and swim to the next area.

When you get outside, you will see a ghost ship, a few houses, and a lighthouse with a flashing beacon. Go to the boat dock. From here you can jump to the roof of a nearby house. Travel from that roof to the roof of a smaller house behind it near the rock wall where you can gather some hidden items (secret 7). Enter the ghost ship through an opening adjacent to the center mast. Once inside, face the green hanging cloth. Head left and enter the upturned dining room, which is filled with enemies around every turn, rather than going to the 2nd floor. Grab the Eye Key from the back corner of the room and head to floor 2. In this bedroom you must kill the Phantasm. This will open a passage at the bed's headboard, allowing you to enter the sunken ship. Enter the water and go to the opposite end of the boat (the kitchen) where you will find the Skull Key behind a panel requiring the Eye Key for access. On the way back, stop in the underwater area filled with floating boxes. Turn immediately left and you will find a switch on the back of a wooden box stack. Use it to reveal Super Armor and some Tommy Gun ammo (secret 8). Backtrack to exit the sunken ship and the ghost ship. Go to the lighthouse and take the Skull elevator to the top. Grab the Moon Key and go back down. Use the Moon Key on the other elevator, which will carry you down to the end of the mission.




<<< E2M7: Paradise Lost >>>

Paradise Lost is going to be the most challenging map you have come across in this episode. There is a lot of scenery look at but make sure you keep your eyes out for enemies, too. Walk out of the cave and continue through the crystal cavern. You will come to the entrance of a stone fortification where light is flooding out. We will refer to this as the "fort." There is some water you will be heading into flowing under the fort, and if you have some spare ammo dive down there now and take out the Gill Beasts behind the bars. There is also a hidden stash of goodies if you face the underwater bars and swim forward and to the left (secret 1). Enter the fort and clear out the enemies. You may need to draw them out of the fort into the blue area to get some space. Drawing the Hell Hounds out into the water is also useful if you are low on ammo. If you enter the fort and make an immediate right you will be by a serpent panel. Open it to reveal a Life Seed (secret 2). Go to the space behind the brown glass window and use the "water gate" switch. This opens the underwater bars. Go back out to the blue area, swim past the bars, emerge on the other side to grab the Eye Key, then return to the fort's main area. Go down the hall and open the eye door. There is a Zealot on the other side so be ready to fire. Go up the steps and travel until you see Tchernobog. When you get close a band of Zombies are going to crawl out of the ground. Alt fire Spray Can works wonders here. Eventually a wall behind the Zombies will lower allowing you to continue along a ledge to the backside of the fort. Be careful not to fall off. There is a corpse outside with a bloody handprint you will want to press (seeing a pattern here?) to open a stone wall. Behind it you can grab some Fire Armor and a Napalm Launcher (secret 3). Get the Dagger Key and open the nearby gate. Return to the first floor of the the fort and go in the other door. A Choking Hand will pop out of a little vase so be careful. Ahead Tchernobog will appear again. What a pest! Get close and he will turn into several enemies. Do not run ahead because there are more foes beyond this point by a locked gate. This little section is deceptively difficult so do not rush. You may even need to run out of the door you came in through after the first batch of baddies is summoned to get some space. Open the gate with your Dagger Key and run into the cave ahead. There is a corpse outside that drops Guns Akimbo. Before diving into the cave's pool, search the cave for a secret passage that will give you some health and Invisibility (secret 4). Hop in the cave pool and quickly swim straight ahead until you see the surface of the water. Do not let the Gill Beast along the way slow you down too much. When you emerge on the other side you will be able to see the shore to the right. If you go to the left underwater you will find a secret alcove with some nice items and a Life Leech (secret 5). Past the shore is a large area with lots of enemies and lots of room to maneuver yourself. The altar in the center has a vital Voodoo Doll. Kill the enemies who surround the Stone Gargoyle then use your Voodoo Doll to chip away at his health. Alt fire Life Leech is also useful in this battle. When the Stone Gargoyle perishes a new entrance to the fort will open on the far side of the battleground. Let your Life Leech do most of the work here if you have already laid it down. Otherwise, alt fire Flare Pistol is effective. Go through the new opening, grab the Spider Key, and head back to the main floor of the fort. Zombies are going to be EVERYWHERE after this sequence, so feel free to drop a few Proximity Mines at the Spider doorway as you go through. Navigate through the supply room and take the Moon Key. You will need to go back through the Dagger Key gate from earlier to get to the Moon door, but there is a small Zombie army waiting for you. Dodge as many as you can and hurry through the door. You may need your Shotgun to get the Gargoyle out of the way quickly so you do not get trapped. Jump down the hole in the ground and you will land in some water. Walk towards the light. Tchernobog will launch some fireballs at you so do not run up too fast. Keep walking into the light to end the mission.




<<< E2M8: The Black Tower >>>

The Black Tower is really going to put you to the test. It is very large and will take more skill to survive than was necessary in Paradise Lost. Walk out of the cave and go left. Grab the weaponry and head through the rest of the forest. Watch out for the Zealot around the corner. When you emerge from the trees you will be able to see the black tower and the battleground that lies before it. There are 2 battalions out here: One in the center that will engage you immediately and a second that will approach when you get closer to the tower. Also in the center is Tchernobog, who will summon a batch of Zombies when you get close enough to the tower. There are a lot of ways to get through this, and it really depends on how much and what kind of firepower you are packing. Napalm fire, alt fire Flare Pistol, and alt fire Life Leech are great if you can spare it. Save your Tesla ammo for the tower entrance. If you are low on supplies make use of all your Proximity Mines and TNT from long range. You are not going to be able to quickly get inside the tower so do not try running past everyone - they will catch up eventually. At the mouth of the tower (literally) there will be some fire pods and more Zombies when you get close. Draw the pod's fireballs so they land on the Zombies if you can, then kill the pods. Go behind the tower to get a Life Leech (secret 1). On the left side of the mouth there is a hidden entrance with Fire Armor and a Life Essence (secret 2). When you step into the center of the mouth a wall will open releasing Cerberus and some hounds. Unload your Tesla Cannon on Cerberus. If you run out of ammo, keep moving backward while firing - you will have lots of space. You can try blowing Cerberus off the cliff to his death but it is pretty tough to do. Once he's dead you will be able to enter the tower. Go around the corner and step into the glowing light. You will be transported to the tree gallery. Each tree acts as a portal to a unique area. In each area you will need to hit a skull shaped switch. The order in which you activate them is irrelevant. Once you hit all 5 you will be able to use the floor portal in the main gallery area to exit back to the tower interior. Activate the stone face behind the 2 Gargoyles to open a panel near the glowing light revealing Super Armor (secret 3). Go to the new area that has opened up and drop down the hole to the right into sub level 1 of the tower. 

Go into the next room and pick up the Tesla Cannon on the ground. Proceed across the  invisible bridge, dodging (by hopping through) Tchernobog's fireball rings. Cross to the other side and head down the ramps in the lava filled area to tower sub level 2. There is a Gargoyle nest at the top of the magma area that you can jump to, but be very careful as the magma will instantly burn you to death. The reward is significant: A Life Seed, Body Armor, and Tesla ammo (secret 4). Journey across sub level 2's invisible bridge to the doorway with magma falls on each side. There is a Stone Gargoyle flying up above that you will need to kill, but do not get near the Voodoo Doll unless you want to fight the enemies behind the door at the same time. When the Stone Gargoyle is dead grab the Voodoo Doll if you have not already and fight your way into the room with the invisible floor above a magma flow. Move around the ring-shaped hallway and hop into the glowing light. You will be transported outside of the tower where you will have to fight your way back inside. Enter the tower, head right and go up the stairs. Take the elevator up to the tower's top floor. You will see the Fire Key as the path ends. The wall in shadow by the Napalm Launcher has a handprint on it. You know what to do! Press it to reveal a secret ammo stash (secret 5). When you grab the Fire Key the area is going to flood with monsters, so you may want to lay around some Proximity or Remote Mines beforehand. Head back to the room with the invisible floor above a magma flow on sub level 3. Enter the fire door, descend to sub level 3, and walk through the magma tunnel. The mission ends shortly after. 




<<< E2M9: Legion >>>

Like Vertigo, this is a short mission. However, you will be doing MUCH more fighting. Any strategies you have for fighting large groups will be needed. Walk into the cave and grab the ammo. Crawl through the rock tunnel and head right at the steps to grab some ammo at the top. The bottom of the stairway will lead to an invisible bridge. When you are  nearly on the bridge Tchernobog's specter will launch some fireballs your way. You will probably want to be away from the back wall when dodging them. Do not run up to Tchernobog - he will explode when you get close. Go to the next room and you will see another specter. This one will summon some Zombies. Attack them and wait for the door on the side to open. The battle begins! You can tackle this any number of ways, so I will just explain the sequence:

Wave A: When you enter 4 Fanatics will appear at the top of the stairs. There is a Guns Akimbo there but you may want to save it. Some other Cultists are hidden behind pillars in the area. If you jump off the top of the altar where Tchernobog is floating onto the rock wall, you can run along the top to the right until you reach a hidden Napalm cache (secret 1). Once the last Fanatic has fallen you will trigger Wave B.

Wave B: Tchernobog will summon Acolytes and Zombies everywhere, so do not stand in one place. Eventually a wall will drop releasing more foes and Cerberus, who can be goaded into fighting or killing other enemies. A Zealot who is released alongside Cerberus will drop a Tesla Cannon so be sure to grab it. If you run to where Cerberus emerged you can go left onto a hidden ledge for a Life Leech and Super Armor (secret 2). When Cerberus dies, Wave C begins.

Wave C: You get a few more Zombies before another wall drops, releasing the final set of foes. After you defeat the Stone Gargoyle the episode will end. 




<<< E2M10: Dread Faction (Secret Level) >>>

Dread Faction is a great chance to fill up on some powerful weaponry halfway through the episode as long as you have the quick reflexes to fight off large numbers of Zombies. When the elevator stops, head straight ahead and take the lift up at the end of the sewer. Go around the corner and head into the rock area with a large metal gate. Go left and hit the switch to raise it, then hop into the supply car. Use the control panel by the sleeping Zombie then head to the back where the doors will open exposing the Skull Key. Use it to open the gate on the opposite side of the car to proceed to the food car. Lower the elevator to the left first, bomb the Cultists riding the platform, then open the gate. Grab the Eye Key in the kitchen and be sure to check the fridge for health. Press on the bloody handprints near the elevator to reveal some Flares (secret 1). There is a Fire Armor in the furnace (secret 2). Go back down the elevator and head to the dining car through the eye doors. The Fire Key lies behind the next set of double doors past the dining area. In the dining area there is a serpent panel near the entrance to the food car (secret 3). Head back to the food car and open the fire door. Grab the Dagger Key and go back to the food car. Continue forward until you open the dagger door and reach a locked door behind 2 Zealots. Climb around the ledge and get atop the head of the train so you can jump down from the roof into the engine room. Once in the engine room, hit the 2 switches and stand back before the train crashes. Before hitting the switches, you can run into the furnace and grab a Life Seed (secret 4). Move along through the wrecked train and the sewer to the facility rail cart. Ride it to the facility and move into the steam/disinfection room past the Phantasm. Press on the control panel to start the sequence. When you hear the chime a door will open to a large room made up of 4 pathways. At the center is a key panel where you will open up the blue, red, and white sections (in that order as you obtain a key from each area you enter). Zombies are here in enormous numbers, and will return with reinforcements each time you complete a colored section (along with Gill Beasts in some areas). Activate the blue section first with the Dagger Key you obtained earlier.

Blue:
One door leads to some supplies. The next is a small room with some cryo tubes. Hit the switch on the computer panel wall and grab the Moon Key. Return to the key panel and use the Moon Key.

Red:
One door leads to a diving suit. The next is a large room with a large cryo-water tank. Ride the elevator down then press on the computer panel at the end of the walkway. The water level will rise high enough for you to jump in without injury. Swim to the bottom and grab the Spider Key. On the ride back using the elevator you will be able to hop onto the far ledge across the gap without hitting your head on the ceiling. There are some Tesla supplies behind the waste barrels (secret 5). Return to the key panel and use the Spider Key.

White:
One door leads to some supplies. The next is a small room with some cryo tubes like the blue section. Hit the switch on the wall with the danger sign to open the final pathway behind the key panel. There is a deluge of baddies in there so ready your explosives. 

At the back of the pathway the door is locked, so you will be heading into a vent near the doorway. Crawl through and blast the Zombies. Behind them in the corner near the couch is some hidden Spirit Armor (secret 6). Head down the elevator where you entered the train depot and get ready to take down the final wave of Zombies. Get your Napalm Launcher out for this or you could easily get trapped. Run back to the elevator you came down in the beginning of the mission and hit the switch to bring it to and end.  




<<< E2M11: Behemoth (Transition Level) >>>

Travel down, avoiding the water (it is filled with Gill Beasts). Once you move across the entrance to the building you will have a variety of Cultists and Cerberus on your tail. Blast the Zealots if you need Tesla ammo. Cerberus will drop a Moon Key upon death. Use it to head through the dagger door ahead on the left. The mission ends shortly afterward as you move ahead. There is only one secret in this mission. Go into the water pool in the former hand statue room and dive in. You will find a Life Seed behind a gate (secret 1).




********** EPISODE 3: WAR IS HELL **********




<<< E3M1: Whisper Peak >>>

The final episode begins! Whisper Peak is paced slowly and is not too dangerous, but your weapons will be very limited - use them wisely. Head out of the bathroom and journey until you reach the boathouse. If you hop into the chimney you will find a disturbing room with a Life Seed pickup as you enter (secret 1). On the far side of the boathouse shore you can grab a flare pistol (secret 2). Take the boat across the lake and proceed to the town. You can jump off the first parked vehicle you see and land over a nearby wall to collect some hidden Proximity and Remote Mines (secret 3). A very useful Life Leech is located behind the sign at the corner of the road (secret 4). Walk along the road until you get to the Skull Key sitting next to a radio. Use it to enter the pub and head out the exit door behind the bar. Get the Eye Key and hop on the trash bin. You can hop off the top of the bin into a nearby window to get Basic Armor (secret 5). Jump off the bin over the fence and go to the mechanic's shop across from the pub. Open the gate with the Eye Key then head up the stairs. Open the back gate, which will give you access to the rear of the building but also releases a Hell Hound, which is very strong against fire weapons so do not waste flares. Out back you will jump into a well to get the Fire Key, giving you access to the school. Head in and take the first right into a classroom to get some ammo before continuing. There is a bloody locker on the left side of the hallway that you can press on to reveal Body Armor (secret 6). Go right at the end of the hall. Outside you will find a Black Chest. Once you touch it, head back inside and down the new hallway. Keep going until you reach the new area with Gill Beasts, or "normal floor." Take the first right into the goo, or "goo floor," then swim straight across to the Dagger Key. Return to normal floor and use the Dagger Key on the switch. Go to goo floor and enter the last doorway on the left (there is a diving suit nearby where the Gill Beast emerged). Hit the switch. There is a Gill Beast who will drop a Life Essence around the corner where the spikes are placed if you have low health and spare ammo. Return to normal floor. Head through the open mouth passage. Continue into the next mouth passage ahead to be whisked away to the end of the mission.      




<<< E3M2: The Room >>>

This one is a little tricky. The Room will have you traveling back and forth from the Room aka the "apartment" and what I will call "subway world," with new sections of subway world unlocking each time you come from the apartment. You will start in the apartment, which resembles an apartment from E1M7. Grab any goodies lying around and go to the front door. Shortly afterward the bathroom door will open up. You will find a hole in the wall. Climb in and you will be transported to subway world. Go left and get inside the ticket booth to open the terminal gate. Now you can get on the track. If you go right behind the rail-block you will see a switch that will reveal a hidden Life Leech inside a pillar (secret 1). Do not travel down that track into the darkness to the right or a train going the wrong way will splatter you all over the rails. If you head left you will see a Skull Key. Quickly grab it and run before you get crushed. Open the skull door down where the Zombies are buried next to the track. Descend the stairs, go under the overhead tracks, and up the elevator. Straight ahead through the door you will see a Shotgun. Grab it and kill the Acolytes. To the right of the Acolyte on the right is a metal panel with flecks of green on it. Press it to reveal a passage with a Life Seed (secret 2). Go to the top of the stairs and turn left. There is a giant blue SLOTH poster on your left. You can jump through it to find a hidden ammo stash (secret 3). Ahead there are some foes who will need to be dispatched. Do not ignore enemies in this mission - you will be revisiting a lot of these areas and your problems will only compound. Head down the ramp to the big terminal. Keep your ears perked for that giant subway car - it can easily demolish you. However, it will kill your enemies just as well, so feel free to lure them into its path. Sometimes the ammo an enemy drops cannot be picked up if the subway performs the kill (engine glitch) so kill them yourself if you need supplies. Get the Eye Key near the gates at the other side of the terminal. While you are there, head down to the furthest phone booth and use it. A secret passage will open up which houses a Super Armor (secret 4). Head back to where you killed the Hell Hound and go to the end of the walkway where you will need to get into the ticket booth and use the eye switch. The gate that moves will release a Hell Hound. Past the Hell Hound is a supply closet with a hole leading back to the apartment. This time you will have to attack 3 shadow-like ghosts in the apartment to open up the bathroom. There is one on the couch, one in the kitchen, and one in the bedroom closet. The bedroom bookshelf can be lowered by pushing it, revealing some ammo (secret 5). Once the ghosts are gone, go into the bathroom and return through the (now much larger) hole back to subway world. Walk in the rain over to the stairs. Go up and grab the Dagger Key, which will open the gate ahead. To your left you can press on the big poster, revealing Beast Vision and some Body Armor (secret 6). Go back to the far side of the big terminal and enter the gateway locked with a dagger switch. Go out the door straight ahead and turn left. The ghost nearby is going to transform into some Gill Beasts so be on guard. Touch the wooden box under the flickering light and turn around. You will see a portal with green rings open up. To your right is a broken elevator. If you can make it past the door without getting crushed you will end up with a napalm launcher in your possession (secret 7). Go through the portal and you will arrive in the final twisted version of the apartment, which you can finally leave. Watch out for the Zombies just outside the door and head towards the door on the floating platform. Enter into the white light to end the mission.    




<<< E3M3: Shadehaven >>>

There are a lot of places to explore in this mountainside citadel. The number of enemies may be fewer than some of the later missions, but their placement makes the each fight in this mission a little more dangerous than usual. Cross the wooden bridges to Shadehaven's entrance. If you hop on the ledge to your right and walk around the side of the structure you will find a little switch. This will lower an elevator to take you up to a high platform. Follow the walkway around to the other side of the structure, leaping over the gap as you go. You will discover a hidden Life Seed (secret 1). Return to the entrance. Hit the switches on each side of the entrance to unlock the front doors. Go inside. We will call this spot (where your back is to the entrance doors and you are facing the inverted cross) "Shadestart." Head to a flashing red elevator on either side of the inverted cross wall and head to the crystal room. Approach the inverted cross from this side of the structure and it will open up, allowing you to reach the Eye Key. Jump to grab it and fall in the golden water pool. Swim straight ahead into the next area through a tunnel and hit the submerged Eye Switch. This will open the portal directly ahead. Enter the portal and grab the Skull Key directly behind you. If you jump through the closest hanging wall cloth above the water you will obtain Body Armor (secret 2). Jump in the water, grabbing the ammo scattered on the floor, and swim back to the area with the Eye Switch & Portal so you can escape the water. Return to the crystal room and open the Skull Doors. Ride the elevator to Floor 2. Enter the blue hallway on the left and you will end up outdoors. Continue to the yellow stable, watching out for a Hell Hound that is extremely difficult to shoot due to the wooden fence. Go through the wooden door and pick up the Shrink Shroom at the end of the passage. Return to Shadestart. 

Go through the doorway on the right then down the checkered stairs. Straight ahead is a hole in the wall near the floor. When you approach this area with the Shrink Shroom you will be able to access the next area. There is another, larger hole in the wall next to the small one. Go outside through the whole and you will see a tiny switch on the dark outer wall. Press it to reveal some nearby ammo (secret 3). When you are in the shrunken area, go straight through the opening in the wall. If you need Fire Armor, walk behind some of the other floor pieces in this area before continuing (secret 4). Grab the Fire Key. When you do, a wall will open to a cavern with tiny blue lights. Take the Grow Shroom from the center and exit the hole, after which you will return to normal size. Open the nearby gate with the Fire Switch, then proceed until you reach the Fire Elevator, which will return you to Floor 2 (you can also take the Skull Elevator from earlier). Enter the hall with the neutral colored light. Kill the enemies and hit the Fire Panel, which will unlock the 2 elevators in the room. If you take the closest elevator to the outdoor area overlooking a previous part of the mission, you can locate a switch behind a rock pillar which will reveal some Proximity Mines and Basic Armor (secret 5). Afterward, return to the area with the Fire Panel. Go to the far elevator and ride it up. Walk ahead over the metal grating until you get to the Fire Door. Pass through and go up the stairs and into the portal at the end of the hall. Now you are in the inverted hall where you can reach the Dagger Key and a second portal to the left of it. Grab the key and enter the new portal. You will fall into a pool of water by the metal grating. Use your new key to lower the gate outside the pool and reenter the main Floor 2 area. Go left into the Butcher's Dining Hall. Use your key on the Dagger Door in the back and kill the Spiders just beyond inside the 4-way hall. If you crawl through the Spider hole you can get some Spirit Armor (secret 6). If you go down the left hallway you can pick up some ammo. In the ammo room there is a switch hiding just above the entrance. Hit it to lower the shelf nearby for a Life Essence and Guns Akimbo (secret 7). The door opposite the dining room in the 4-way hall leads to a long passage with flashing red lights. At the end of the hall is the Spider Key. When you take it Phantasms will appear so be ready, especially since the entrance door opens slowly and in most cases you won't be able to simply run past them without taking damage. Return to the main area of Floor 2 and go to the center where the 4 pillars and skylight are located. Hit the 3 Spider Switches and then the skull-faced switch. The floor will rise up, giving you access to the roof. On the roof, proceed to the vessel near the rock wall to find the end of the mission.




<<< E3M4: Bogey Beach >>>

This is the most open-ended map in Death Wish so tackle it as you see fit, luring enemies into the ocean or slaughtering your way right down the boardwalk. This walkthrough will cover the latter. Exit the vessel and the bookstore, then grab the Shotgun and turn right - a vehicle with Cultists will be heading your way. Blast them and break into the little office building. The hallway to the left has the Skull Key (watch out for You-Know-Who's transformation trick). In front of the center chair at the meeting table is a tiny switch near the floor. Press it to lower some filing drawers which conceal an Invincibility Mask (secret 1). Grab the key and head outside. There is some ammo laying on the beach so get that before you leave the area. Behind one of the gray brick walls down on the beach is a Basic Armor guarded by a hidden Gill Beast (secret 2). Go into the alley next to the office and hit the skull switch, which will open the large gate on the other side of the wall. Go there, and take the ramp onto the boardwalk. To your right is a Gill Beast of whom you should be mindful, and to the left is the main stretch. If you go straight ahead and jump into the ocean you will come across a drowned corpse next to some Napalm ammo (secret 3). Down the main stretch, take as many enemies down from afar as you can manage, just as you did at the beginning of The Black Tower. Behind the Fry Shack is a Voodoo Doll (secret 4). You will need to jump off the waste bins or an enemy to get over the fence. The Fry Shack has some ammo inside. The boardwalk-side entrance to the office is locked so you will have to break through the window to get the Tesla Cannon. The Gameland arcade has some dangerous foes in it so be sure to clear it out. If you crawl under the bars of the Skee Free game you will see a switch the the top. Press it to open a panel with some ammo behind it (secret 5). The water ice stand has nothing of value. Go to the open area with the light posts. Before you grab the key by Tchernobog destroy the garbage on the right of the trash bin. You will be able to get into a small hole that leads to Fire Armor (secret 6). See that gray brick wall between the 2 stands and the bait shop? You need to get over that. Go to the left stand and climb on the boxes beside it so you can jump to the roof of the stand. Hop to the roof of the right stand and then leap over the wall. You will get Key 7, which is needed to reach the secret level later. Grab the Eye Key. When you do, Tchernobog will float away, leaving you to fight some Hell Hounds and Acolytes. Go to the liquor store around the corner and grab the Fire Key inside. Do not run in too hastily or you will get shot up by the fanatics behind the cash registers. Go to the bait shop. The top floor has some Shotgun Shells and a Flare Pistol. The bottom has the key room, which you will need your Eye and Fire Keys to enter. The back of the boat has a shutter you can lower to get a Diving Suit and a Flare Pistol. If you drop into the water you will find some ammo hiding under the boat, but it is a long swim back to shore (secret 7). Starting at the boat, walk across the gate and onto the gray brick wall, then head over to where the Acolytes are/were throwing dynamite. You will find a Life Seed (secret 8). Go into the key room and take the Dagger Key, which gives you access to the hotel on the other end of the boardwalk. Enter the hotel and continue until you have the Spider Key. Go back where you came from and you will find that the path has changed. Grab the Moon Key at the bottom of the swirling platforms and quickly run back before the Acolytes bomb you off the ledge. Exit the hotel and return to the boat. Press on the boat's cabin door to end the mission. However, if you'd prefer to go to the secret level, go to the liquor store. Shoot out the large window and jump across the water to the ledge with the gate. Enter the opening and proceed to the spider door. Inside you will find 3 boxes of Flares (secret 9). See the row of switches? Pull the one labeled "7," which requires Key 7. A ventilation shaft will open. Duck into it. On the other side you will find yourself on the roof of a building. Search around the roof and you will see a tiny green ring. Touch it and you will be sent soaring to the secret level (E3M8).    




<<< E3M5: Duck & Cover >>>

Duck & Cover will be your first big challenge in this episode. There are a lot of firefights with large numbers of foes, and you will have to develop a strategy that works best for you in each situation, as your tactics will vary greatly depending upon whether or not you brought a lot of long-range weaponry into this mission from your previous efforts. Grab the Flare Pistol and wait for the door to get destroyed. Go outside where you will see the fortified shoreline. Shimmy around the ledge of the boat to the back and lower the shutter for some Remote Mines that will really prove useful if you are low on shells and bullets (secret 1). Swim to shore and kill the Hell Hounds. There is an Acolyte wandering around atop a tiny guard post on the beach. Hop from the wall to the tank deterrent to his platform for some Body Armor (secret 2). Head into town for the first big battle. The first building on the corner to your right can be entered by jumping off the waste bin. Once up there, press the bookshelf to reveal some Reflective Shots (secret 3). Behind the building that has toppled over you will find some Shotgun and Spray Can ammo (secret 4). Enter the building with the hole in the side from an air strike. Get the Skull Key, grab the TNT from the area in which the Zombies emerge, and then leave the structure. Go straight ahead past the gates. Do not get near that beeping box - it is a powerful, armed proximity mine! Lure the Zombies lurking nearby to it. Grab the Medical Kit in the phone area then head to the ticket booth for the museum. Get in the booth and use your Skull Key on the switch to unlock the elevator. Ride up. The great hall of the museum is littered with Fanatics. After you kill one of the Cultists at the front desk they will start to scurry around from their hiding places behind the pillars. Kill as many as you can before they split up (a few alt fire Flare Gun shots being ideal). When you get to the big Tchernobog statue take a left into the middle gallery. Doorways on your right and left will lead to the upper and lower galleries. Descend to the lower gallery. In the middle you will see a Tome. Prepare yourself to fight a Zombie horde and take it. Fight your way back upstairs and go to the upper gallery. One of the paintings in the upper gallery can be moved by pressing on it, revealing Fire Armor and Proximity Mines (secret 5). In the center of the upper gallery the Eye Key is now available. Take it and head back to the statue in the great hall. Go up the stairway (watch out for the hiding, prone-positioned Fanatic) and descend the ramp created by a fallen building. As you go down, you will see some enemies to the right. One drops Guns Akimbo, which you may want for the firefight coming up. To the left of the ramp is a stone ledge. Walk along that ledge and you will come to a Life Leech (secret 6). At the bottom of the building ramp you will have another battle. Watch out for the hidden Cultists in the alleys between buildings. Behind the long building with the vent on top you can get your hands on a Napalm Launcher and some Tommy Gun bullets, but watch out for the armed mines laying on the ground (secret 7). When the battlefield is clear open the eye door and get the Fire Key. Go back up the ramp, continue through the great hall (watch out for the air strike), and take the elevator back down to the ticket booth area. Turn right and use the Fire Key to enter the brick building. There is Hell Hound right around the corner so toss some explosives ahead of you before entering. Climb up the wreckage and jump atop the slanted ledge of the adjacent building. There are 3 secrets clustered in this area. 

1: Jump on the other, higher pillars close by. If you miss it is going to hurt. Leap from there to the open window where the glass has been shattered. You will find a Medical Kit (secret 8). 2: Jump from those same pillars or from one of the smoking pipes into the exposed, upper-level apartment hallway. Out on the ledge next to it (near where the wall was destroyed earlier in the level when you first saw the beeping mine) there is a Life Seed (secret 9). Down at ground level there are some Flares (secret 10). You can get these if you accidentally fall into this area or you can hop off an enemy's head over the wooden fence to reach it at any time.

Near the slanted ledge you will see a window you can jump into. Do so, then take the elevator hidden behind the wall to the bomb shelter. There is a shelf you can press down there on the right as you go through the wrecked doorway which will reveal a diversified ammo cache (secret 11). Get the Dagger Key from the back room and escape the bomb shelter before it goes up in smoke. Take the dagger elevator to the top floor. Tchernobog is going to spawn some pests if you get close to be sure to throw an explosive his way. Take the Spider Key and make your way outside the building down to the area near the phone where Zombies are now running around. Use the Spider Key on the radio next to the wall to call in an air strike. The explosion will destroy the wall by the phone, allowing you to reach the minefield. If you get close to one of the gray boxes you will take major (if not lethal) damage, so shoot or explode them ahead of time. You will see a hole in the rock wall across the minefield that you will need to reach. Enter it and you will be on your way to the next mission.   




<<< E3M6: Inferno >>>

Inferno is one of Death Wish's most formidable missions, and it should be â you are nearing the end! You will be doing a lot of traveling and backtracking between a few key locations. The level is made up of 3 sections: 
1. Areas above fire pit aka "overworld" 
2. the area with all the magma and ruined temples aka "fire pit"
3. Areas below the fire pit aka "underworld"

Overworld & Fire Pit
Run out of the cave and take the long elevator ride down. The water below is shallow so do not take a high dive. Jump in the lake and swim under the waterfall. You will reach a new area with 2 pools (they connect underwater). You may want to hop out from the far pool since you will emerge from the water behind some foes rather than in their sights. Face the Hell Hound gate and turn right. The 4th pillar by the water has a bloody handprint for you to press on one side, which will reveal a Life Seed (secret 1). Hit the switch at the gate where the Hell Hounds are trapped. If you are low on ammo simply lure them into a water pool. There are 4 Hell Hounds total so make sure one did not run off and hide. Hit the switch in the room by the lift to lower the spikes around it. Shoot the switch in the shaft of the lift to raise the platform (which has 2 Hell Hounds on it). Ride the lift down to fire pit. There are many Cultists and Acolytes to dispose of on the walkway ahead, but most importantly is the Mother Spider. One well placed explosive attack will send her flying into the magma, killing her instantly and saving you a lot of ammunition. I suggest a normal dynamite toss directly in front of her (it may take a few tries to get her airborne). The path ends in a temple structure with several openings and the gateway to underworld (in the center of that giant mouth). We will call this structure "fire hub." There are Fanatics behind all the pillars in here so get ready to fight. One of the stone faces on a pillar is greenish instead of completely gray. Press it to open a panel where Reflective Shots and some ammo are hidden (secret 2). On the left side of fire hub you will come to a window. From there you should be able to jump to a broken-up brick walkway. Enter the room at the end of the path and grab the Skull Key off the throne. Return to overworld via the lift, which will be guarded by some newly arrived Acolytes. Go straight ahead to the skull gate. Tchernobog, who stands in your path, will become some gargoyles (who will die like Hell Hounds if you can get them in the water). You may want to lay some Proximity Mines just before the gate entrance - it will help quell a Zombie battalion that arrives shortly. Past the gate there are 2 paths. Either way works well. If you go right kill the Cultist and take the 2nd doorway on the left instead of the first so the walkway Fanatics are not so close when you enter the walkway. The long walkway has 2 Fanatics. There is a small pool along this walkway. Jump in and grab the Eye Key. This will summon a Zombie horde outside the skull gate. Before you return there go to the lone door in the room with the shining yellow light. Lower one of the bookshelves by pressing on it, then leap from that bookshelf to the one across form it as it rises. Press the bloody handprint and a secret compartment will open up. Go inside to collect Fire Armor, which is vital for this mission (secret 3). Fight through the Zombies and return to fire hub. You are done with the overworld section. From fire hub, go to the room with the throne. On the right side near the magma you will see the eye switch. Use your Eye Key and the nearby platforms will start to move to and fro. The magma will kill you instantly so time your jumps well. Grab the Dagger Key in the room beyond the platforms then return to fire hub. Go to the right side of fire hub and open the dagger gate. Cross the invisible bridge and obtain the Fire Key. You will have to move quickly to avoid getting set ablaze by the Fire Pods nearby. If you jump to the sandy area where the Pods lay you will find a small tunnel, leading to a Hell Hound nest and some Tesla supplies (secret 4). Return to fire hub and use the Fire Key to open the gateway to underworld inside the mouth. Jump in the hole.

Underworld
You will see 2 blue representations of creatures called "specters." You will need to lead a creature of that type to the space. There are 2 ways to go down here. They are mirrors of each other, except one side is used to summon Zombies and the other Gill Beasts. Go to the Gill Beast side. There will be a pack of Cultists and Acolytes at the end of the orange-lit hallway. As you go around the corner past the Phantasm you will see a river of sludge and a statue on the other side. Get near the statue to summon the creature. You will see the summoned creature as you make your way back to the main area with the specters. Lure the creature into the correct specter space and explosions will kill it instantly. Repeat this process on the Zombie side. For the Gill Beast side only, if you face the statue and look left you will see a stone engraving. Break it apart and you will be given access to a secret room with a life leech (secret 5). Once you have completed the task for both sides the mouth wall will open, releasing some Hell Hounds and Cerberus. Inside the mouth there is an elevator down to the temple of flesh, but it will not work until Cerberus is defeated. When he is dead, go down the elevator and go through the wind tunnel. You will be spit out into a vat of goo. If you face the direction of the wind tunnel and swim right, you will find a secret tunnel under the goo filled with goodies (secret 6). When you emerge from the goo, get onto the shore and step into the space with the flickering light. The bone pillars will split, allowing you to go left or right. You will need to hit a switch at the end of each path. Go left and soon you will come to a strange room with a transforming pit. Do not fall in! Trick the Zombies into falling down to their deaths if you wish and hit the skull shaped switch on the opposite side. Return to the flickering light. Go up the right path. You will come to 3 blood pools. Jump in one, then head through the right-side tunnel. Emerge from the blood and head forward through the self-dividing passage to reach the second of the switches. Return to the flickering light, using the blood tunnel on the right as you journey back. The exit from the temple will now be available. Step onto the tongue and the mouth will open, revealing an open area with a boat as well as a few Cultists and Fanatics. They will start firing as soon as the mouth opens so be careful. When you get out to the boat, go underwater to grab the Moon Key. If you jump over the water and onto the stone walkway, you can turn left and head into the water behind the metal bars to collect a Body Armor (secret 7). Watch out for any enemies who may have fallen in. When you have the Moon Key, turn the steering wheel on the boat to end the mission.   




<<< E3M7: Last Rites >>>

The end is near! This mission is not more difficult than the last if you have enough powerful weaponry, but it does include one big challenge that is really going to test your skills even if you are stocked up on ammo . First, hop in the water and take a swim to the sandy floor. you will see an opening at the bottom of the nearby structure that conceals Body Armor (secret 1). Go back to shore. Grab the Tommy Gun and beware the lightning that will strike a nearby tree. Ahead, the path splits 2 ways. Straight ahead you should be able to see a Napalm Launcher, but it is better to head left for now. Steps will lead to an open area with a small water pool which contains a Life Essence should you require one. Executing an attack on the water pool section properly will take some timing:

By the time you reach the pool of water there will be Cultists coming from the right and the left. Immediately kill the closer ones on the left. Before the ones from the right can reach you, turn around and fire at the TNT Barrels placed by the wall Ñ the resulting explosion should kill several (if not all) of them, saving precious ammo for the real battle ahead. Walk to the area where the Cultists from the right appeared, out near a walkway where you get a view of the clouds far below. Kill the Acolytes and grab the Napalm Launcher. There is a stone face placed high on the wall out here. Shoot it and an Invisibility Cloak will be revealed (secret 2). You may want to save this for later. Head back where you came from and go past the water pool to the top of the stairs. There is a Fanatic up here that will drop the Skull Key upon death. In the same area, there will be some rocks you can climb on overlooking the water and the boat. Jump from there to the rock ledge by the metal fence. Run along the fence around to the other side. When you run out of room, you should be able to see a small opening nearby in the rock wall when you face the water gate. Jump to this opening (this can be tricky) and enter the cave. Inside you should find a VooDoo Doll, Proximity Mines, and a Life Essence hidden in a rock pillar from which some Spiders will emerge (secret 3). Return to the gate in front of the water pool. Open it. When you do, Tchernobog will laugh and explode, spawning Zombies. Behind him is the Hall Gateway. Kill the Zombies the head left around the corner. There are many enemies down this corridor, so be careful. Acolytes are positioned on high ground here, making them more dangerous than usual. You may need to duck down below the fallen pillar for cover. When the area is clear go up to the little building with the bright red floor. Go the through it and head to the other side by the fence. There is a tiny face switch attached to the side of the building out here. Press it to open a stone panel where a Life Leech hides (secret 4). Go into the cavelike area, following the red floor until you come to a Wooden Chest. When you pick it up, the Hall Gate will open. Go there and prepare for what is arguably the most difficult battle in Death Wish.

Beyond the gate is the Hall Path, with the Hall Foyer seated at the top of the stairs. When you walk down the path the 4 Chosen will appear Ñ Priests who act like Cultists with high health. When they lose all their health they will transform into Beasts, which are a handful. You will need to kill all 4 of them to progress, and there are several ways about it. Grab the Guns Akimbo if you need it, which will be likely. Using pure firepower to kill them is not recommended, especially on the higher difficulty levels. When they get close you can usually stun them momentarily with a Alternate Shotgun blast before they can use their stomp attack, but since there are so many of them this can be difficult. Your best bet is to knock them off one of the cliffs in the level, either by the Hall Path or where you picked up the Napalm Launcher earlier. I find it is easier to lure the Beasts to the Napalm area and blast them one by one off the walkway as they come around the corner with the Alternate Shotguns Akimbo attack. You may want to convert only a few of them to the Beast stage at a time to avoid getting swarmed. Flares are good for this. You may also want to lay down a Life Leech somewhere if you are going the way of brute force. When all 4 are dead the entrance to the Hall Foyer will open, releasing a slew of baddies. Wipe them out and carefully enter the building, as there are probably a few that did not make it outside.

Inside the foyer there are 6 stone slabs with skulls on them. The center slab on the left (when facing the foyer throne) can be lowered when you press it, revealing some Spirit Armor and Beast Vision (secret 5). Approach the foyer throne. Hit the switch and some Bloated Butchers will be released along with a Mother Spider. Take out the Butchers first with explosives and then take on the Mother Spider. When she dies you will be able to progress past the foyer throne to the Hall of Epiphany. If you look past the fire on either side of the foyer throne you will see a stone engraving. These can be destroyed with an explosive, allowing you to access a hidden passage that leads to Fire Armor and 2 Spray Cans (secret 6). After a confrontation with Tchernobog you will need to enter the Hall of Epiphany and go to the throne room on the far end. Take the Eye Key and return to the boat at the beginning of the mission. On your way back before reentering the foyer, there's a secret to pick up. Go to where Tchernobog was standing and face the foyer. Climb up the pink rocks to the left side of the foyer and move along the wall. You will find a golden face switch what will reveal Gasoline when pressed (secret 7). When you open the Eye Door, look right. You will see a platform with a ladder next to it. Jump up there to get the Moon Key then return to the throne room in the Hall of Epiphany. Use the key to lower the pillar in the center of the room, which will open the passage to the final mission.




<<< E3M8: Dead End (Final Boss Level) >>>>>>

The grand finale - when you get close to the floating island, hop off and let the battle begin! The stone pillars can be lowered by pressing on them. There is Fire Armor behind the portal. If you break the blue glass in the center of the arena you can get a Life Seed and a VooDoo Doll, but you will have a hard time doing it without taking fire damage from Tchernobog. When you defeat Tchernobog walk into the portal and you will be transported to another dimension where you will have to defeat his spirit form. In this place you will accelerate as you move around unless you are standing on the center platform. If you run out of ammo here you will have to resort to using the Voodoo Doll on Tchernobog, which does little damage but will not deplete your ammo as long as you only use the primary attack. When this form is defeated, step into the portal circle to end Death Wish! 



<<< E3M9: Nightmare (Secret Level) >>>

Nightmare is a strange mission, created with chunks of architecture from episodes 1 & 2. It may also be the most difficult of the secret levels. When you start the mission, you will notice that it resembles E1M1. This impression will not last. Grab the ammo in the downstairs closet. There is a Gill Beast right outside the front door, so have your Shotgun ready. Behind the house, there are 3 Cultists guarding a Black Chest. Touch the chest and return to the front of the house, where you will notice that the environment has opened up. You will see some slanted platforms leading to a doorway you will want to cross through. The Fire Armor sitting on the platform far away is deceptively difficult to reach without falling to your death, so only go for it if you are a jumping expert! Through the door there are 2 Zombies. This is "Firebelly room" aka "HOD room." In the next room,  to the left ("Jigsaw room") there is a Fanatic and a Cultist, the latter of two being right in the doorway. Two Zombies are on the sides of this doorway, just out of sight. If you step into the room, a door will open releasing Rats. Make sure you go into the Rat holding cell to take the Medical Kit. There are Hell Hounds just one the other side of this wall, so do not try to jump through the opening (although you can throw some explosives). If you jump in the bathtub you will find that it is quite deep, with Body Armor at the bottom (secret 1). Proceed to the next room with the blood-filled boiler/furnace. Wipe out the enemies - you will be returning here. If you hop in the boiler you can press on one of the walls to open it. You will find yourself rewarded with Limited Invisibility (secret 2). Note the moon door in this room - you can come back to later for a super secret. Head outside and go through the window to the apartment bedroom. The closet has some items but grabbing them will summon a Phantasm near the bathroom. Go in the bathroom and head through the hole beside the bathtub. Note the translucent Gill Beast specter. Grab the Skull Key ahead and return to the HOD room. Open the skull door and jump over the white flames to summon some Gill Beasts outside the room. Lead one back to the translucent specter and the adjacent door will open. Carefully hop from one platform to the next until you make you way onto the floating vessel. There is a Life Essence sitting alone on a platform off to the side, but it is much easier to reach that platform than to escape it without falling to your doom. Enter the vessel's rear entryway. Outside the windows there is a ledge with Reflective Shots (secret 3). When you go out the front entrance of the vessel you will be fired on by several Fanatics. Beyond them lies a twisted chunk of E2M5 aka "paradise room." To the left you will see find some flares next to the eye door. Jump up to the windowsill. If you look across to the wall you will see a serpent panel. Destroy it and grab the Moon Key that lies behind it. If you return to the moon door in the boiler room you can obtain a heap of hidden goodies (super secret!), after which you should return to the paradise room. Head up the stairs and turn right. You will see a large, dark room. Once you step down into the room go right for the Voodoo Doll, then advance toward the floating stack of ghosts. When you get close they will disappear and release 2 Stone Gargoyles and some Acolytes behind you. When the Stone Gargoyles are dead, a door at the for end of the room (near where the ghosts were) will open, revealing the Eye Key. Grab it and head back to the eye door inside the paradise room. Follow the invisible walkway and you will end up back in the area where you just defeated the Stone Gargoyles, only now a new area directly across from you will be open. There is a small troop of varied Cultists who will begin their assault, so ready your long-range weapon of choice. You will find that this new area is the rear entrance from E2M4. When you approach the floating demon in the distance it will transform into many Gargoyles and Zealots. Defeat as many as you need to continue safely. If you jump up the ascending string of pillars you will find an entrance to the side of the castle. Go through the entrance and defeat the Gargoyle so you can obtain some ammo (secret 4). If you go to the lit side of the cross in the main area you will see a switch where the 2 beams meet. This lowers a platform holding a Life Seed on the left side of the castle entrance (secret 5). Inside the castle you will see a white ghost of Caleb. When you get close it will transform into a swarm of Tiny Calebs, so you may want to chuck a dynamite bundle at it. Go left into the cave. Move forward until you reach a giant face in the darkness which will carry you to the next mission. 




<<< E3M10: Morning Gory (Transition Level) >>>

You reawaken in the Low Tide Liquors of Bogey Beach. Grab the ammo in the store and exit. If you exit out via the hole in the wall you can get to a ledge with some Shotgun Shell Boxes. There is a trash can sitting by the side of the arcade. Break up the waste nearby and crawl through the tiny passage to claim some Proximity Mines. Down the boardwalk there is a battalion of Hell Hounds and Cerberus, who will drop a key upon death allowing you to exit the level at the front door to the docked boat. If you need more firepower, grab the Guns Akimbo out of the back of the boat. If you get desperate you can jump into the (now shallow) ocean area to escape a sticky situation.  

There are 4 secrets strewn about the mission. 
1. In the water, just under the boat, is a VooDoo Doll.
2. Behind the "Fries" stand an Invisibility Cloak can be found.
3. The hotel pool contains Fire Armor.
4. Climb over the brick wall where you found Key 7 in the Bogey Beach mission to get a Napalm Launcher.
