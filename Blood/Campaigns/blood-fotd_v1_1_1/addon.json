  "description": "https://www.moddb.com/mods/fate-of-the-damned\r\n\r\nFate of the Damned is a meticulously crafted custom campaign for BLOOD which aims to speculate and explore another shadowed path that Caleb might've undertaken. While taking care to never stray far from the gameplay formula that made BLOOD so gripping, the campaign will see Caleb journey through new environments that he has not seen before. Gruesome new discoveries await as Caleb tears through hordes of the undead, and nothing is left unscathed in his quest for vengeance.The version 1.1 release contains the following features:\r\n\r\n- 2 episodes consisting of 18 maps total, which fully support Single Player, Co-operative, BloodBath and Capture the Flag across all difficulty settings.\r\n\r\n- A series of exhilarating, all new, low resolution cutscenes which tell the campaign's story.\r\n\r\n- Lots of new, chilling music as an optional extra.\r\n\r\n- A splash of custom art that is used sparingly.\r\n\r\n- A large amount of fiendish secrets waiting to be discovered.\r\n\r\n- Challenging and occasionally downright unfair encounters with BLOOD's monsters, unsuitable for those whose faith is weak.\r\n\r\n- Support for the NBlood and BloodGDX ports - to a point."
