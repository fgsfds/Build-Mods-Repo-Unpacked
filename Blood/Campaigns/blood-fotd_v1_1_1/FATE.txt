GENERAL INFORMATION

For best results, if using the ports, the Classic renderer is recommended for
playing Fate of the Damned. Polymost can introduce a handful of visual errors,
but these are generally quite benign and won't affect play. Feel free to stick
with Polymost if that is your preference.

The Blood Voxel Pack for ports is unfortunately not recommended for use while
playing Fate of the Damned. While an effort has been made in the maps to
orient sprites so as to support the mod, and the mod has undoubtedly got a lot
of very good work put into it, version 0.95 of it, the most recent at the time
of this writing, does not support sprite offsets, which means that some
objects in Fate of the Damned can have their position incorrectly reproduced
when using the mod. As a general rule, the player is welcome to use the pack 
for playing Fate of the Damned if they love voxels, but be warned that some 
sprites and shadows will look very peculiar, and as a result of the offset
issue, certain objects in the add-on will at times not look correct. 

BLOOD: FRESH SUPPLY

Please note that Fate of the Damned is NOT supported by Blood: Fresh Supply.
While you can certainly launch the maps, there will be numerous errors as a
result of Fresh Supply incorrectly reproducing BLOOD's behaviours. You will
have a severely impacted and generally poor experience of the add-on if you
insist on running it in Fresh Supply. This is true at the time of this writing
for Fresh Supply version 1.9.10. Perhaps this will change in future, but
Fresh Supply updates don't seem forthcoming at this time.

NBLOOD

1. Extract the FATE folder from the zip file. 
2. Place the FATE folder as-is in your BLOOD directory.
3. Launch NBlood using nblood.exe.
4. In the "Game" list shown, select BLOOD: One Unit Whole Blood - BLOOD.ini
5. The dropdown beneath the list reads "Custom game content directory". Open
this dropdown and select FATE.
6. Click "Start" to begin.

BLOODGDX/BUILDGDX

Be advised that BloodGDX/BuildGDX version 1.16, the most up-to-date release at
the time of this writing, does not perfectly reproduce everything as expected
for Fate of the Damned. There are a few peculiarities in its behaviour, but
most are cosmetic and shouldn't be a problem. There is however one notable bug
towards the end of E2M6 which can result in a shocking inconvenience to the
player. This error can be avoided with some clever play or cheats. While this
is a pity, it would be extremely unproductive to change design decisions for
the benefit of specific ports which may well be updated in future. That said, 
Fate of the Damned is serviceable on BloodGDX. NBlood is recommended as an 
alternative to avoid the dangerous bug referenced above and achieve nearly 
perfect accuracy in replicating BLOOD's behaviour.

1. Extract the FATE folder from the zip file.
2. Place the FATE folder as-is in your BLOOD directory.
3. Launch BuildGDX using BuildGDX.exe.
4. Select "Play Blood".
5. On the game's main menu, select "New Game".
6. On the list that appears, select "<User Content>".
7. On the "Directories" list to the left, select "FATE".
8. Once FATE is opened, select "BLOOD.INI" from the list on the right.

DOS/DOSBOX

Fate of the Damned will only work with One Unit: WHOLE BLOOD version 1.21.
You'll probably have some luck with 1.20's Plasma Pak 3DFX version, but it's 
not recommended.

Note that BLOOD on DOS can sometimes run into errors which cause crashes when 
running Fate of the Damned. Please see the troubleshooting section for more 
information.

Attempts have been made to keep installation as simple as possible. However, 
DOS environments can behave differently across different machines for numerous
reasons. What follows will first be the best-case scenario in which 
installation is happening on DOSBox and behaves as expected, followed by a 
worst case scenario in which everything goes wrong and the player needs to get
their hands dirty in DOS. If a player is using DOS on an ancient or very 
specialised machine, it's safe to assume that they know how to get add-ons
working for BLOOD, so a base level of knowledge will be assumed in the 
instructions for that case.

Assuming that the player has the GOG installation of One Unit: WHOLE BLOOD and
is trying to run the game using DOSBox with as little effort as possible on
Windows:

1. Extract the FATE folder from the zip file.
2. Place the FATE folder as-is in your BLOOD directory.
3. Copy/move FATEINST.BAT, FATEINST.CONF, FATEINST.LNK (the shortcut),
FATE.CONF and FATEUNST.CONF into the BLOOD directory.
4. Modify the "Target" and "Start In" properties of the FATEINST shortcut to
point to the desired installation folder. By default, the shortcut points to
GOG's default installation location, which seems to vary based on different
releases GOG has performed. Be sure not to replace the DOSBox command line 
parameters. Below is an example of correctly modifying this shortcut, assuming
the player is not looking to use the default directory:

Target:
"C:\GOG Games\One Unit Whole Blood\DOSBOX\DOSBox.exe" 
-conf "..\dosboxBlood.conf" -conf "..\fateinst.conf" -noconsole -c exit

Start in:
"C:\GOG Games\One Unit Whole Blood\DOSBOX"

Should instead read:

Target:
"C:\Games\Blood\DOSBOX\DOSBox.exe" 
-conf "..\dosboxBlood.conf" -conf "..\fateinst.conf" -noconsole -c exit

Start in:
"C:\Games\Blood\DOSBOX"

5. Run the FATEINST shortcut. This will execute a little installation tool.
6. Follow the steps in the tool.
7. Modify both the FATE.LNK and FATEUNST.LNK (shortcuts) as done before with
FATEINST.LNK to point to the desired installation folder. These can be used
to run Fate of the Damned and uninstall it, respectively.
8. Run the FATE shortcut to play Fate of the Damned.

What follows are steps for players who prefer to do things manually in
DOSBox's environment, or who are attempting to install the add-on for DOS:

Assuming everything works as expected:

1. Extract the FATE folder from the zip file.
2. Place the FATE folder as-is in your BLOOD directory.
3. Copy/move FATEINST.BAT into the BLOOD directory.
4. Run FATEINST.BAT. This is a little installation tool.
5. Following the steps in the tool, everything should be made ready.
6. Run FATE.BAT from the BLOOD directory to play Fate of the Damned.

Assuming nothing works as expected:

1. Extract the FATE folder from the zip file.
2. Place the FATE folder as-is in your BLOOD directory.
3. Copy/move FATE.BAT into the parent BLOOD directory.
4. Copy TILES018.ART into the parent BLOOD directory.
5. Open FATEINST.BAT in a text editor and copy the lines with FATESND.RFF in.
6. Execute the three copied lines (commands) while in your BLOOD directory.
7. Run FATE.BAT to play Fate of the Damned.

Assuming absolutely nothing works and you're on the verge of tears:

1. Don't panic.
2. Install a fresh copy of One Unit: WHOLE BLOOD (optional, but a good idea).
3. Extract the FATE folder from the zip file.
4. Place the FATE folder as-is in your BLOOD directory.
5. Copy/move FATE.BAT into the parent BLOOD directory.
6. Copy TILES018.ART into the parent BLOOD directory.
7. Open FATE.BAT with a text editor (notepad is fine).
8. Edit and save it so it only reads: BLOOD.EXE -ini FATE/blood.ini
9. Running FATE.BAT at this point has to work unless there are system issues.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Here lie the names of the files which Fate of the Damned is distributed with
as well as descriptions of what they do. If this is distributed with any file
not listed here, or if any files are missing, then it is to be considered an
unauthorized distribution.

FATE.TXT - the file you're reading now, a document to accompany the add-on.

BLOOD.INI - the initialization file BLOOD needs to ensure the maps form a nice
coherent package when run.

The maps themselves, namely:
FATEE1M1.MAP
FATEE1M2.MAP
FATEE1M3.MAP
FATEE1M4.MAP
FATEE1M5.MAP
FATEE1M6.MAP
FATEE1M7.MAP
FATEE1M8.MAP
FATEE1M9.MAP
FATEE2M1.MAP
FATEE2M2.MAP
FATEE2M3.MAP
FATEE2M4.MAP
FATEE2M5.MAP
FATEE2M6.MAP
FATEE2M7.MAP
FATEE2M8.MAP
FATEE2M9.MAP
FATEHOLD.MAP - a placeholder of sorts used when selecting episodes which 
aren't yet released from the menu. This "map" ensures that those selections 
gracefully bounce back to the main menu.

TILES018.ART - a file containing the custom art which is used sparingly by the
add-on.

The cutscenes which play throughout the episodes:
FATEcs1.smk
FATEcs2.smk
FATEcs3.smk
FATEcs4.smk

The audio which accompanies the cutscenes:
FATEcs1.wav
FATEcs2.wav
FATEcs3.wav
FATEcs4.wav

The custom MIDI tracks for players who choose it as an option:
fatet1.mid
fatet2.mid
fatet3.mid
fatet4.mid
fatet5.mid
fatet6.mid
fatet7.mid
fatet8.mid

Three batch files designed with the intent to make setting things up easier on
DOS/DOSBox, but which have no use for players who use the ports:
FATEINST.BAT - an installer file to prepare the add-on for play.
FATE.BAT - a file to launch the add-on.
FATEUNST.BAT - a file to remove all Fate of the Damned files from the parent
BLOOD directory, to make uninstalling the add-on a little easier.

Three .conf files, which DOSBox can use to launch the batch files, but which
have no use for players who use the ports:
FATEINST.CONF - a file which calls FATEINST.BAT
FATE.CONF - a file which calls FATE.BAT
FATEUNST.CONF - a file which calls FATEUNST.BAT

Three .lnk files, which act as shortcuts to launch DOSBox with the appropriate
.conf files, but which have no use for players who use the ports:
FATEINST.LNK - a file which launches DOSBox and starts the installation
sequence.
FATE.LNK - a file which launches Fate of the Damned in DOSBox.
FATEUNST.LNK - a file which launches DOSBox and starts the uninstallation
sequence.

FATESND.RFF - For DOS/DOSBox only, this file is generated when the installer
is run and for legal reasons shouldn't be part of the distributed archive. In 
a nutshell, it is a copy of BLOOD's sound archive with the custom music tracks
added to it, which the add-on depends on to play the custom music.

No BLOOD files are modified by this add-on, and the only risk of file
conflicts are likely to be TILES018.ART on DOS/DOSBox, which follows a formula
which BLOOD requires for custom art to be used. Most other add-ons with custom
art will likely have a file with an identical name, which is something to be 
aware of. The user will either have to swap out the art file on a basis of 
what they're playing, or install another copy of BLOOD to dedicate to the 
add-on.

If all the files listed above are deleted manually, Fate of the Damned will be
completely removed from one's computer. BLOOD will remain pure.

                      3. Troubleshooting & Known Issues
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

BLOOD: FRESH SUPPLY

Fresh Supply does not support Fate of the Damned. Hundreds of problems will be
experienced if trying to run the add-on with Fresh Supply. It would needlessly
inflate an already long document and, frankly, be quite pointless to list the
issues which the player will experience. Players are strongly advised to not
play this add-on using Fresh Supply.

NBLOOD

NBlood is the least problematic way to play Fate of the Damned. It has near
perfect accuracy in reproducing BLOOD's behaviour, and no errors have been
encountered during extensive testing.

Please follow the installation instructions in the first section precisely and
there will be no problems.

If you see problems relating to peculiar clipping sprites or weird "completely
opaque" shadows, it is likely that you are using the Blood Voxel Pack, which 
can cause some visual problems with the add-on. These shouldn't affect
gameplay for version 1.1 of Fate of the Damned. If the player finds them too 
harmful to immersion, disabling the Blood Voxel Pack will make these appear 
normal. 

BLOODGDX/BUILDGDX

"Out of free XSprites" crash:
This crash indicates that there have been too many objects "generated" during
gameplay, such as monster gibs, bullet casings, bullet holes, and so on. This
error is most likely to occur during E2M6 and E2M7 at higher difficulties.
These crashes are the consequence of unsound level design, and there are only 
two ways to avoid them. Either one can play using the NBlood port, which 
increases the upper limit on the amount of these objects that can be
generated, solving the problem, or the player will need to play more 
"cautiously" with this risk in mind. Playing more cautiously means that the 
player will need to use fewer explosives to avoid creating gibs and not create
more casings, shells and bullet holes than is necessary. The issue should
clear up as the player advances through the map, so the "caution" will only be
necessary at the start.

E2M6 end of level "surprise fall":
This error is a consequence of BloodGDX not reproducing expected trigger
behaviour in BLOOD correctly. While it is a pity, it would be foolish to
attempt to cater to each individual port version's idiosyncrasies, and so this
is being left as-is for now. It is up to the player to either cheat or
develop a clever trick to survive the hazard. The impact of the fall can
probably be survived if the player can manage to somehow secure and retain 200
health.

If you see problems relating to peculiar clipping sprites or weird "completely
opaque" shadows, it is likely that you are using the Blood Voxel Pack, which 
can cause some visual problems with the add-on. These shouldn't affect
gameplay for version 1.1 of Fate of the Damned. If the player finds them too 
harmful to immersion, disabling the Blood Voxel Pack will make these appear 
normal. 

DOS/DOSBOX

src\resource.cpp(416): Out of memory! crash:
This crash can sometimes occur in DOS and is usually tied to launching a
cutscene too many times sequentially. This error shouldn't repeat if a player
is cautious and doesn't willfully attempt to invoke it, and simply launching 
the game again after the crash should allow it to be bypassed.

src\db.cpp(756): Out of free XSprites crash:
This crash indicates that there have been too many objects "generated" during
gameplay, such as monster gibs, bullet casings, bullet holes, and so on. This
error is most likely to occur during E2M6 and E2M7 at higher difficulties.
These crashes are the consequence of unsound level design and there are only 
two ways to avoid them. Either one can play using the NBlood port, which 
increases the upper limit on the amount of these objects that can be
generated, solving the problem, or the player will need to play more 
"cautiously" with this risk in mind. Playing more cautiously means that the 
player will need to use fewer explosives to avoid creating gibs and not create
more casings, shells and bullet holes than is necessary. The issue should
clear up as the player advances through the map, so the "caution" will only be
necessary at the start.

"Fog" is absent:
This issue is caused by launching BLOOD and loading straight into a saved
game. It can be solved by starting a new game from the main menu and then
loading the saved game.

GENERAL ISSUES

Cutscenes aren't playing:
For ports, it is important to ensure that installation instructions are
followed. As long as the .smk files are present in the FATE folder which is
being pointed to by the port, the cutscenes should play. In DOS, this error
indicates that the .INI file is not being run from the same folder that the
cutscenes are stored in. Both the .INI file and the cutscenes should be kept
in the FATE folder and executed via a batch file (FATE.BAT) or a command line
run from the parent BLOOD directory.

Cutscenes have no sound:
It's highly unlikely that this should happen, but if it occurs, be sure to
check that the .wav files accompany the .smk cutscene files. They should
play correctly if they are stored together in the FATE folder.

Textures and objects look completely weird and broken:
Fate of the Damned is intended to be run with only the base BLOOD art tiles
and the included TILES018.ART. Please be sure that the BLOOD being used as a
base for running the add-on is not contaminated with weird art files from
other mods, with Cryptic Passage being a good example.

I was in a moving object and fell out of it and died:
BLOOD is not very good at respecting boundaries when the player is inside of
moving sectors which comprise vehicles. It is generally the case that running
around wildly and pressing against walls will enable the player to clip
through the wall and exit the vehicle, sometimes resulting in death.
Unfortunately, there isn't terribly much map designers can do to prevent this,
and instead it is recommended that players try keep still as much as is
reasonably possible when inside a moving vehicle. This is sound advice for
real life as well.

I'm dying a lot. There are too many cultists and too few supplies:
Fate of the Damned is intended to challenge players to some degree and assumes
a reasonable skill level in a player since BLOOD has been out for over 20
years at this point. Be on the lookout for stashed supplies. Secret areas can 
go a long way to give advantages, and it is often the case that particularly 
challenging segments have multiple possible approaches to them. If the maps
are simply too difficult, dropping a difficulty level should help things go
smoothly, since the maps do support all difficulty levels. The intent of the 
maps is to be enjoyable first, with the option of higher difficulties for 
advanced BLOOD players to challenge themselves. If you are dying constantly 
and not having fun, it is highly recommended that you reduce the difficulty 
level by one. If any player wishes to bring this up as something that somehow 
detracts from the add-on, they are welcome to play Hallowed Grounds, The Great
Temple, House of Horrors, Monster Bait, The Ganglion Depths, and Forbidden 
Rituals, amongst many others, at higher difficulties.

KNOWN ISSUES/MAP-SPECIFIC ISSUES

There are generally two types of problems associated with BLOOD map 
development. There are elements which I cannot control and those which I can.

First, what I cannot control.

BLOOD has a fairly ugly bug embedded in its code whereby certain timers will
trigger well after the maker has instructed them to. This bug can spoil 
otherwise intricate sequences by having certain elements be delayed, sometimes
by an impressive amount.

This bug is most prevalent and destructive in events whereby certain triggers 
need to fire in sequence. A good example of this is the moving platform with 
chains over lava seen in E3M5 "Spare Parts". Play for long enough and you will
certainly see the upper platform move separately from the lower part, ruining 
the sequence.

One has two possible reactions to this issue as a creator. Either you avoid 
such sequences altogether, or you boldly move forward and dare the bug to show
its face.

In former times I was quite nervous about this and attempted to evade numerous
issues with regards to clipping and desync errors in BLOOD, but I have chosen
instead to move boldly forward and try create something impressive which works
most of the time. If you should encounter something that looks a little funny
in my work, it is quite likely the result of this bug. Run through the events
again and they should look correct.

Now, what I could've controlled, but didn't.

Firstly, as a result of fairly foolish design choices, a notable glitch in my
maps appears in E1M9 "Morningside Springs". I made some poor choices with 
regards to the room-over-room design, and you will fairly easily get some 
"hall of mirrors" problems if you look at certain areas which have an upper 
and lower level. This is just a monument to my foolishness, however, and won't
interfere with gameplay.

When it comes to the second episode of my work, for better or ill, I truly 
pushed the engine to its limit with regards to scale and what it can do using
the original game, and I think this will come across nicely in the player 
experience, but this foolhardy desire to push things far came at great cost - 
there are risks throughout various maps in the second episode of crashes. Now 
BLOOD is forever at risk of crashes at random, but these crashes are specific 
to certain sprite limits being reached and exceeded.

If you should encounter these crashes, which are most likely to occur on Extra
Crispy difficulty, I would suggest trying again with a slightly more cautious 
approach to combat; each monster blown up produces additional sprites, but if 
a monster is kept intact, it counts as a single sprite instead. Attempting a 
different path in a map can also help prevent these issues.

Regardless, should you encounter these crashes, I offer my apologies and hope 
you will look past them and continue to enjoy what I have provided. I will
attempt to be wiser with my design decisions in future work where applicable.

I am aware that certain moving sectors in E2M7, if not stopped by the player, 
have a high risk of desynchronising and creating truly ugly visual bugs. The 
complexity of this level is such that I took this risk knowingly. While the 
player has no reason to not halt the motion, a devious player can fairly 
easily reproduce this problem by leaving certain sector motion in operation 
and returning to it later. The player will then be rewarded with egregious 
visual errors. While this seems similar to what I describe as a bug that I 
cannot control above, I feel partially responsible for these in as much that I
could've reduced their complexity and instead chose not to. Write these bugs 
off to another price to pay for how intricate the map turned out.

Finally, the complexity of the end of the second episode was such that I 
couldn't make it possible to repeat the process in cooperative play. 
Essentially, should you die in cooperative play at the end of the second 
episode, you will have to start the level over again. I simply didn't have 
enough resources and made the conscious decision to press forward with my 
vision for Single Player at the expense of cooperative play. My apologies to 
cooperative enjoyers who encounter this - such is the heavy price of your 
failure.

                                4. Changelog
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Given that this is release v1.1 of this project, there are naturally some 
changes to the existing material. This might not be terribly interesting for 
some players to read, but I include it for a sense of completeness. Naturally 
this contains some measure of spoilers.

General Changes (applied to all maps):

 - An entire new episode has been added! Episode 2: The Shadow Out of Time.
   This episode advances the story and is made up of 9 new Single Player maps 
   which also support BloodBath, Capture the Flag and Cooperative play.

 - Older cutscenes have been reworked fairly significantly and should now have
   a much nicer flow with enhanced special effects and visuals.

 - Fire sprites have been correctly set to have maximum brightness and no
   transparency. This is to bring things in-line with retail convention.

 - Doors should across the board be faster and some should permit
   interruptions. I had an annoying habit previously of making doors painfully
   slow in their movement. This is the exception rather than the rule in 
   BLOOD, and many doors should now correctly be fast and allow the player to
   interrupt them (though not always).

 - Lighting and shading has been vastly improved for older maps. While not 
   looking to change the old maps entirely, I have made some of the oldest 
   maps look a little bit better in some places.

 - Episode 1 maps have had slight adjustments to their architecture in places
   to make them a little more sensible and attractive. While I'm not a big
   believer in continuously iterating on ancient work, these maps were in need
   of some polish in certain areas.

 - The text on the circle on the floor in the throne room of the Hall of the
   Epiphany in the first episode has been painstakingly changed to represent 
   the one seen in the retail opening cutscene. Check it out for a secret to 
   be revealed.

 - All sprites should now have directions set in order to support any voxel 
   packs which might be released.

 - Ambient sound volumes have generally been reduced in the first episode, as
   they were a bit too loud in certain areas.

E1M1 Changes:

 - The level name has been changed from "Tchernobog's Fatal Flaw" to "Last 
   Communion". The initial name was a little too on the nose and didn't roll
   off the tongue nicely.

 - Fixed an issue whereby the player could seal the main doors and run 
   outside, resulting in being locked out of the Hall forever and being unable
   to fulfill his destiny.

 - Ophelia's sprite has been replaced with a nice one of her standing 
   patiently. No more idle t-posing!

 - Removed some thematic elements which no longer fit the story.

E1M2 Changes:

 - Some small architectural adjustments were made to make the level a little 
   bit more attractive.

 - The secret with the well in now has the innocents drop the life essences
   instead of having them lying about. This is to bring it in-line with retail
   convention.

 - Slightly adjusted the dimensions of a pillar on a staircase to prevent it
   from reliably crushing the player if they tried to pass by.

E1M3 Changes:

 - The pesky pods have been removed from the map. I have decided that they are
   better suited for later. They have been replaced with - you guessed it - 
   more zombies.

 - The "cargo onboarding sound scene" has been moved to the end of E1M3 from 
   the beginning of E1M4. The sequence will now play out upon completing the 
   level.

E1M4 Changes:

 - The "cargo onboarding sound scene" has been removed and placed at the end 
   of E1M3 instead. This was done to be more accommodating to players who play
   by rules that require that they restart the map each time they die, such as
   "pitchfork starts". It was incredibly annoying to have the player be 
   restrained for a long duration each time the map began, and this should 
   hopefully provide much needed relief for the difficult opening of this map.

 - Moved the positioning of one of the sawed-off shotguns to be closer to the
   player's starting position in order to slightly reduce the difficulty of 
   the opener when starting the level with only a pitchfork.

 - Fixed a horrible ambient sound "popping" effect as the result of having 
   created this map's ambient sound in an idiotic way.

 - Made the ground surrounding the trains correctly pull the player and 
   monsters at rapid speeds. Previously the ground would only gently tug on 
   objects, which, although correctly killing them, didn't look very exciting.

 - Added a little more room to the outside of the dining carriage entrance. 
   This was previously quite small and made attacking this difficult area 
   even more challenging than it already was.

E1M5 Changes:

 - Moved one of the map's sawed-off shotguns out of a secret area and instead
   put it on the train where the player begins in Single Player in order to 
   reduce the difficulty of the map when starting with only a pitchfork, since
   the opener was otherwise a little too difficult.

 - I have modified the secret level entrance puzzle to be much easier. If
   players still cannot solve it, it will have to remain a mystery.

 - The access to the secret level now has text notifying the player that they
   have found the secret level.

 - Rejoice! This level is now fully supportive of cooperative play! The player
   start locations have been adjusted so that players no longer tumble to 
   their deaths forever after dying for the first time.

 - Beware! The Moon Key machine guns will now function as expected in 
   cooperative mode.

 - Fixed an issue whereby the train would remain with its doors forever sealed
   in BloodBath mode.

 - Opened up the ventilation system a tiny bit to make it more comfortable for
   players to traverse.

 - Removed some thematic elements which no longer fit the story.

E1M6 Changes:

 - The brightness of the map in general has been slightly increased. The map 
   is now extremely dark as opposed to ridiculously dark.

 - The difficulty of the map's underwater ambush has been slightly decreased.
   The ambush segment was extremely unforgiving and should now still be 
   daunting while not being too traumatic to the player. The map has also had 
   a handful of extra supplies provided to make it a little easier.

 - Extra pockets of air have been created on the way to the underwater ambush 
   to make the underwater section a little less oppressive.

 - An underwater secret has been adjusted to make sense with the rising of
   water...

 - Prompted an ambushing bloated butcher on higher difficulties to put a 
   little more effort into his job than staring stupidly at the player.

 - Simplified a swinging light effect animation that would desync during 
   standard play. It should now look correct.

 - Added a switch to the final elevator in the map in cooperative play to 
   prevent an issue whereby if players were to die at the end of the map 
   before hitting the end switch, they'd be unable to return the elevator to 
   its start position and would be unable to complete the map.

E1M7 Changes:

 - The small elevator leading to the switch controlling the blue bars has had
   its behaviour slightly adjusted to be less confusing.

 - The difficulty of this map has been slightly adjusted so as to be easier. 
   This map was generally too difficult for what was intended for the first 
   episode. While it will still be a challenge and present a lot of combat in
   which Caleb needs to push forward and lay siege to various rooms, cultists
   have been shifted around a bit so as to prevent, notably, the annoying 
   fights that broke out when they held higher ground. These types of 
   encounters, which weren't fun, should be greatly decreased in number.

E1M8 Changes:

 - A little compartment was created that opens up to present the Fire Key. 
   This was done to prevent Tchernobog from dying in an awkward position and 
   dropping the key secretly. It is also not very becoming of dark gods to 
   drop keys.

 - Changed the architecture slightly so as to allow Tchernobog to descend from
   his throne and continue the attack. This is a difficulty increase exclusive
   to cooperative play.

 - Blocked off access to the garden area for BloodBath play. There was no need
   to traverse the gardens in BloodBath.

E1M9 Changes:

 - Removed some thematic elements which no longer fit the story.

                             5. About the Author
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I am Matthew Kallis. I am more commonly known as "Daedalus" in various online
BLOOD communities. I have been a somewhat active participant in BLOOD's online
scene since the early 2000's, first featuring on Monolith Productions' forum,
then the Transfusion project's forum, then The Postmortem forum and, most 
recently, the Altar of Stone forum.

I am very fond of developing content for BLOOD and am the owner of the Altar 
of Stone website, but I would rather bore you to death with writing about 
BLOOD than talk about myself.  Suffice it to say that I have been around for a
long time and am an ardent advocate of BLOOD, who knows quite a bit about the 
game. 

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
                       6. What is Fate of the Damned?
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Let's start with a nice official sounding summary:

Fate of the Damned is a meticulously crafted custom campaign for BLOOD which 
aims to speculate and explore another shadowed path that Caleb might've 
undertaken. While taking care to never stray far from the gameplay formula 
that made BLOOD so gripping, the campaign will see Caleb journey through new
environments that he has not seen before. Gruesome new discoveries await as 
Caleb tears through hordes of the undead, and nothing is left unscathed in his
quest for vengeance.

With that pitch of sorts out of the way, it is time to explain to you 
precisely what you are getting yourself into with Fate of the Damned, but to 
do this properly, it requires that I present context.

BLOOD has had a long and often appalling history with regards to custom 
content. Dozens of user-made episodes and well over a hundred standalone maps 
exist of largely atrocious quality that haunt the game, and for years the game
had no convenient means of adding new content in a simple way, often
requiring ugly solutions in some places, and in others offering none at all.
A large part of my journey in developing maps for BLOOD was driven by
frustration at what I considered at the time a lack of respect for the source 
material. I thought that BLOOD and its players deserved better. Regrettably, 
even to this day BLOOD only has but a handful of custom content made for it, 
but thankfully the quality of it has greatly improved in recent years.

There appear to my mind to be three barriers to entry, its age aside, when it
comes to BLOOD, which are responsible for the severe lack of decent custom
content. The first is, as mentioned above, that until very recently there
existed no dependable method by which to add custom content to the game and
even then certainly no way to achieve it simply. Thankfully, this barrier is
being eroded by good work being done to make the game much more flexible in
its ability to be modded and no longer requiring tricky workarounds just to 
get parts of it running. The second is the massive hurdle and patience 
required to both navigate and learn Mapedit. While this barrier is also 
having good work done to simplify things to some degree, it will and perhaps 
should always remain in place. Mapedit is certainly daunting in its demand of 
tremendous amounts of personal time to get ahead. The third and less tangible 
barrier is that BLOOD is a complicated experience conceptually, and while it 
is certainly simple to play, there are many fragile and intricate elements 
which combine to form the fantastic final product. BLOOD, on its surface, has 
the appearance of a similar gameplay loop to other shooters of its era, but I
believe that it is a largely misunderstood creation in many ways, and this 
lack of understanding can lead to some warped and imbalanced creations for it.
Whatever the case, we are fortunate today to have quite a handful of exciting
custom creations available, even if not all of them quite line up with BLOOD's
gameplay.

I firmly believe that it is possible to integrate BLOOD's gameplay faithfully 
with some degree of innovation if it is done with the appropriately reverent 
mindset. There are very few good examples of this, but I believe I might have
achieved it for my part.

What you hold is the culmination of years of careful construction embedded 
with a deep understanding and love of BLOOD. This text accompanies a product 
which I consider to be an extremely faithful replication of BLOOD's gameplay 
formula with a few exciting twists and innovations in the environment. It is
my love letter of sorts to BLOOD, what it represents, and the culture which
spawned it. It is my hope that you will enjoy it and consider it a fitting
tribute to BLOOD's legacy.

Take your time. Play through the content cautiously and have fun. Good content
for this game comes along only once every few years, or months if one's lucky,
so be sure not to rush through this rare opportunity. Keep your eyes peeled, 
your ears open, explore thoroughly and you may just get through it "alive"!

                             7. The Story So Far
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

SPOILERS! The following assumes that the player has experienced the first 
episode and is moving onto the second.

---

A cold, lingering howl sounds as the dark god Tchernobog's ruined husk falls
unceremoniously to the ground at the great Hall of the Epiphany, the temple 
which had only moments ago served as his seat of power. Without bidding, the 
remnant energies contained by the dark god flow into Caleb, imbuing him with 
strength and longevity. Caleb wastes no time in making his way to the Altar of
Stone nearby, which no doubt Ophelia Price is being held at.

He is too late. Despite Caleb's victory, Cheogh, always jealous of 
Tchernobog's favoured, has murdered Ophelia, Caleb's lover. Whatever well of 
despair or anger Caleb tapped into when facing Tchernobog pales in comparison 
to the unrestrained rage with which he destroys Cheogh. Caleb cuts the bonds 
which prop up Ophelia's body on the cross, and he begins a mournful cremation.

Hours, or perhaps days pass before Caleb wanders back to the Hall to make his
exit. The Cult of Tchernobog, restless and never idle, approaches Caleb as he 
makes his way through the temple, but instead of their conventional reaction 
of attempting to kill him on sight, Caleb is somewhat surprised to hear that 
they are attempting to appeal to him on another level - prophecy. The ranks of
the Cult are filled to the brim with all manner of opportunists; strays, 
runaways, people who simply don't want to be found, criminals evading the law,
and psychopaths. Even at the highest levels of the Cult, at which point the 
cultists begin to take on somewhat otherworldly appearances, there was always 
talk of various prophecies. If there was anything that bound the Cult 
together, no matter how crazed the individual members were, it was faith and 
prophecy.

So it came to pass that all manner of Tchernobog's servants approached Caleb 
and repeated their chants and claims that it was somehow destined that Caleb 
would rule the Cult using the power of the One That Binds. Having been 
betrayed by the dark god whom he served faithfully and no longer needing the 
protection and power promised by Tchernobog, Caleb rejected the destiny 
offered by the Cult and quietly made his way from the temple, leaving
everything in disarray as he reflected on his loss of Ophelia and the
hollowness of his victory.

Caleb spends years and then decades lamenting his loss and wandering the
expanse of his mind in sorrow. He eventually finds himself in a world he cares
for even less than the last one and discovers respite on the outskirts of 
towns and cities at the bottom of a bottle.

The Cult of Tchernobog has not been idle during this time. In the wake of 
Caleb's murder of their dark god and rejection of his role, a power vacuum 
leads to repeated debates and bitter infighting until a new leader emerges 
from their ranks. The leader dictates that despite the absence of their 
master, the time has come to accelerate Tchernobog's plans, and that by 
seizing control of the entire world they would be able to prepare to receive 
their dark god once again without interference and perhaps enable him to walk
the Earth once more.

The year is 1976. A hundred years have passed since the events at the Hall of
the Epiphany. The Cult of Tchernobog has slowly risen, virtually unchallenged 
in the pursuit of their goal and has seized, through both subterfuge and overt
means, many metropolises across the world. In former times they had tried and 
often failed to keep their clandestine practices from public view, but of late
they have grown bolder than ever before. Through tireless effort, unscrupulous
methods and by virtue of their disregard for ethics and personal safety, they
have ascended to a position of enormous influence throughout many societies
and have slowly begun to enact the final phase of their plan for the Earth - 
the assimilation, enslavement or extermination of the unfaithful to the point 
where their rule is uncontested and they alone dictate the future of the 
world.

Emboldened by a few initial victories, the Cult begins readying itself for 
outright warfare and domination of the planet. While they still maintain their
medieval outlook, rituals and appearance, their operating theatre is no longer
exclusively the secret temple and forested nook, but the boardroom, political 
office and public information networks. Their research has led to many deadly 
innovations, both cutting edge and bizarre and it is this ever-growing 
frenzied push which eventually reaches Caleb's tiny slice of the world.

Caleb is one day seized by the authorities during a drunken spell and is taken
to an island prison facility and left to rot. The earth eventually shakes and
his cell bursts open. With a bad hangover and fuelled by a healthy hatred for
his captors, Caleb must find a way to escape this island prison and deliver 
his regards to the Cult who ruined his day - personally. However, Caleb will 
soon find himself challenged by an unfamiliar future which now belongs to the 
Cabal...

                                   8. FAQ
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Q: What is Fate of the Damned?

A: Fate of the Damned is an extremely ambitious Single Player campaign for
One Unit: WHOLE BLOOD v1.21 which attempts to replicate the essence of the
retail game while attempting to expand the universe respectfully.

Q: I can only play two episodes, what gives?

A: Version 1.1 of Fate of the Damned only includes the first two episodes. The
third and fourth episodes have yet to be developed.

Q: Does the campaign support the various ports?

A: At the time of writing, both NBlood and BloodGDX should be supported and 
have no problem running things. I would recommend using the Classic renderer,
as Polymost introduces a few small visual anomalies. Please see the 
troubleshooting section for additional information on the behaviour in the 
ports.

Q: Does the campaign support the "BLOOD Voxel Pack"?

A: I have taken the time to provide orientations to sprites which would and 
could be replaced by voxels. However, the voxel pack introduces a host of 
issues with certain sprite constructions which involve multiple sprites. While
you are free to play the campaign with the voxel pack applied, it is not an 
experience I can recommend for these maps, and you are likely to experience 
visual oddities and miss some detail as a result.

Q: Does the campaign support cooperative play?

A: Yes, it does! You are very welcome to attempt to tackle these monstrosities
with a buddy.

Q: Do the maps support BloodBath?

A: Yes, they do. Not a large amount of the maps in the first and second 
episode are too well suited to an arena style, so I do not think they'll 
provide particularly good BloodBath experiences. I don't expect that to stop 
you, though.

Q: Do the maps support Capture the Flag Team play?

A: Yes, they do. I'll buy you lunch if you can find someone who actually plays
this mode.

Q: Do the maps support different difficulty levels?

A: Yes, they do. Be warned that these maps are directed at players quite 
adept at BLOOD, given the game has decades under its belt now. If you are not 
comfortable with the higher difficulties in general, I would suggest that you 
go with a difficulty below your comfort zone. This campaign will frequently be
punishing to the careless player who doesn't explore and use their environment
effectively. Extra Crispy should provide an excellent challenge for the 
masochistic sort who delves into the deepest layers of BLOOD.

Q: Why did you make this?

A: I have a deep love of BLOOD and have a strong creative streak. I was upset 
at the generally terrible quality of things being made for BLOOD and decided 
to try have a positive impact and make something to give to BLOOD fans who are
hungry for more.

Q: When can we expect the next episodes?

A: While I am extremely ambitious when it comes to BLOOD, I need to make my 
way in the real world and cannot devote all of my time to the game. As I have
suggested, making good quality maps is an extremely time-consuming process,
made even worse by the fact that I have a strong perfectionistic streak. While
I do intend to follow through with the rest of the add-on, it is a question of
at least a small amount of years, though I will do my utmost to try avoid
repeating the amount of time between the first and second episode's release.

Q: Your stuff rocks! Could you please make more?

A: Thanks! As mentioned above, I am ambitious and do intend to make more. I
love this game and Mapedit, so I am definitely committed to making more stuff
that people will hopefully enjoy, but it takes a very long to produce. I am
getting better every day with being more efficient in Mapedit and am trying to
reduce the time it takes to make good quality stuff without having to
compromise on that quality, but there is no secret method to make good things
quickly. As with all things in life, quality takes time.

Q: Your stuff sucks! Why'd you bother making this?

A: Say that to my face in BloodBath and see what happens. More seriously,
BLOOD has many resource limitations, and I am frequently frustrated and left
dissatisfied with the fruit of my creative process. I can only say that if
you do not enjoy it, be sure to check out other modern add-ons, which can lean
into slightly more experimental territories that you may find more
interesting. I believe that I am improving as I go, and each map I make has
harsh lessons that I carry over into future ones. Chances are that if you
don't like the earlier levels, hopefully you'll find some pleasure in my later
works. If not, then you simply aren't my target audience.

Q: Where can I offer feedback or comment on your stuff?

A: If you drop a line somewhere or otherwise invoke my name, chances are that
I'll appear. Otherwise I'd love some feedback on the Altar of Stone forum.

Q: Can you help me with BLOOD or Mapedit?

A: I'd love to. People genuinely keen to learn about BLOOD are quite rare. 
Again, the Altar of Stone forum is a good place to find me.

                             9. Credits & Thanks
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fate of the Damned is the product of Moon Key Productions, a fictional company
which I am the founder of.

I was heavily assisted in Fate of the Damned's production by Fil and Dimebog, 
who respectively worked on both the brilliant visuals and music that featured 
in the additional material.

It goes without saying that none of this would be possible without the 
passionate collection of weird people who enjoy BLOOD. It seems to attract a 
type, and this simply wouldn't be worthwhile without a demented audience to 
enjoy it.

This campaign is created primarily with love and thanks for the nerd with a 
taste for horror who's absurd enough to keep a dusty computer running Windows 
98 in order to play this game, with bonus points if his head is stuck 
somewhere in the late 90's or early 2000's as well. I deliberately set out to 
create a campaign that was both innovative enough to thrill the junkies who 
like new things, but also tremendously enjoyable for a classic guy who just 
wants to run around and shoot things with "none of that funny stuff".

Not that all of them will ever read this, but I would like to thank everyone 
in my personal life who had the unyielding patience to bear with me as I 
disappeared for hours and hours, which the construction of this project 
required. I know that it was not always easy for all of them.

I would like to thank the other creative people who work on BLOOD and do good
work. The mappers, past and handful of present, who have put in the time to
pave the way for furthering people's enjoyment of BLOOD; Bloatoid, SPILL, 
Tedd, DaMann, Wangho, and many others who are lost to time. Thank you for 
helping people to continue to know about, enjoy and experience this game in 
different ways.

To Nuke.YKT, whom I've never met, for his work on NBlood. The value of the
gift of easy access to playing BLOOD for people of the present and future
cannot be understated.

To NoOne for his devoted ongoing work behind the scenes to expand the game's
functionality.

To Hendricks266 for his broader work at keeping BUILD Engine energy flowing,
being a faithful ally and being a voice of reason in an increasingly insipid
modern world.

To Jarmo, wherever he may be, for being Jarmo. Unohda hermosi!

To all of BLOOD's developers, who will never really read this, I offer my
gratitude for making the best game ever.

Thank you, also, to all other quiet creatives behind the scenes who might be
at work performing constructive endeavours for BLOOD. This is not always an 
easy game to work on, but thank you for shining the light on this masterpiece 
that deserves much, much better than it got back in the day.

Thank you to Dimebog for his enthusiasm, insight, talent and impassioned 
support of all that has been done.

Fil - what is left to even say at this point? What good fortune it was that
brought him to me all those years ago. He is hands-down the best and most shy
visual artist BLOOD is lucky enough to have, and it is my supreme fortune to 
have had him as a (somewhat) tireless idea guy to bounce things off of and to 
try make sense of what this project has been and is supposed to be about. He 
has believed in my ability since he first saw a glimmer of potential years ago
in some of my ancient and terrible work and has been a faithful ally ever 
since. To him I offer tremendous thanks for his unyielding if sometimes 
insolent support.

And last, but not least, thank you, the reader and (hopefully) player, for
playing this magnificent game and choosing to dive into my creation. I hope
you enjoy it.

                        10. Closing Ramble & Farewell
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Well, if you have read this far, you are probably one in a hundred million, 
and your patience is legendary.

For a tease of things to come, the third and fourth episode will be quite 
different to what is currently in place. The third episode will involve a lot 
of special effects and supernatural elements, while the fourth episode will 
see Caleb journey all the way to an alternative, horrific world filled with 
blood and evil, unlike any seen before.

As to the road ahead, you will most likely find me in the future quietly 
tending to the Altar of Stone and its accompanying Youtube channel, of which I
am the owner. There is much work to be done on both - far too much to go into
here, and it will require my attention.

If you wish to support me, or more importantly, support BLOOD, please pass by 
and check them out at www.altarofstone.com and 
www.youtube.com/@BloodAltarofStone

While the Altar of Stone is still humble at the time of this writing, I hope 
that it may one day be a kind of nexus of BLOOD communal activity, as BLOOD 
has had a pretty raw deal with its support throughout the years. I cannot 
create community alone, so I hope at least some percentage of those who read 
this will get that far and drop a line or two. If you're feeling brave, I'd 
love to see your BLOOD creations, if you have any.

Now go forth. Spread the glory of BLOOD. Take my creations and make them a 
part of your experience. Turn out those lights, turn up the volume, grab your 
preferred beverage and immerse yourself in my wicked creation. Keep it 
flowing and go SPILL SOME!
