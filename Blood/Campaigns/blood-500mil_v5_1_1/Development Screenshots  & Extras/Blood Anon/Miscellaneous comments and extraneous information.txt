====== Rodent Rebellion ======
The last map I made for this project, loosely based on the plot of "Graveyard Shift". The original concept was a survival-horror esq
map with limited resources, respawning rats and cramped rooms. I quickly realized that was a horrible idea. Jumping nullifies the rats 
bite and "the floor is rodents" was not even slightly fun. Maybe I could have salvaged this idea by designing around platforming
and avoiding the ground, who knows.

====== Tee Off! ======
This is the best map I made for the project without a doubt. Gliding around a wide open non-linear map with jump boots is incredibly fun.
You get multiple pairs of boots, so use them frequently. Getting the golf holes to work correctly was a pain, but certainly worth the effort.
Spending 50+ hours on a level has unusual psychological consequences, I've explored this space multiple times in my dreams. No monsters, no
weapons, just a strange abstraction forever embedded in my subconscious.

====== Shafted 2 ======
A cleaned up, slightly better version of my first Blood map, Shafted. After a few bloodbath sessions, people suggested ways I could improve
the flow and general balance, so I got to work fixing up the level. If you interested in the early design process, I have a video on my channel
documenting it's initial creation.

====== Your Winner! ======
This map was originally intended to be the project logo and nothing more, but I decided to finish it up and conclude the episode here. There are
no monsters in this map, only ambient music and a few un-cracked beers. Relax, you've beaten the episode, your winner now.

====== Closing Thoughts ======

This was my first (and probably only) time organizing a community project. I use the term "organize" loosely. There were multiple setbacks, missed
deadlines and abandoned maps so I opted for a "when it's done" release date. This usually means it wont get done, so thanks for having faith /doom/ OP's.
I'm grateful you guys put up with my bullshit for 5+ months, I hope it was worth the wait.
