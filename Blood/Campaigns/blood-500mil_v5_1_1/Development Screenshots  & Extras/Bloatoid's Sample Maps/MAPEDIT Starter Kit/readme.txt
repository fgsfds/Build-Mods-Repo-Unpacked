MAP STARTER FILE

This is a .map file intended as a starter for your level. It includes 2 rooms
1. Room 1 has some things you may want to use. 8 coop starting point sprites, a few premade gib objects, a set of explode objects that activate when the map starts, dropping some items that normally aren't available, and a regular explode object.
2. Room 2 has a sprite used as a secret counter (RX7; set CMD for 640 for 0 secrets total, 651 for 1 secret total, etc.) and a toggle switch that activates the special item-dropping explode objects in Room 1. I recommend throwing all your switches that aren't meant to be seen in this room since the green walls make it easy to spot while working in 2D mode.

If you have already started building, you can copy architecture into this map by selecting everything by holding Alt, dragging the cursor to make a green selection box, and hitting Insert to copy. Then, load starter.map. Hit Alt again to place your architecture.

Copying like this from inside a map will copy all the properties (RXTXtriggersetc.).

Copying from one map to another will wipe these properties out, leaving only the architecture (you may also have to re-rotate some sprites), which is why you'll want to begin with starter.map and not paste it into an existing level later
