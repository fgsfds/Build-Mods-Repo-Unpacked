1: Pick a light source and stick with it, even if it's imaginary
2: Brightest surfaces face the source, then -5 to -10 brightness as things turn 90‚Å∞ away from it
3: My brightest surfaces based on daylight are usually 20, then down from there
4: I save lower than 20 for really bright things like lights in the ceiling
5: Sometimes I'll cast shadows, but it eats up resources so don't do it everywhere
6: You'll have to figure out how to "fake" dynamic light since everything is sector-based
7: Fill your indoor areas with lights so you have sources to work with
8: When outside, make sure your sun/moon light source is consistent
9: Adjust the "fog" in 3D mode by holding D and pressing + or - (Fog = Depth Cueing)
