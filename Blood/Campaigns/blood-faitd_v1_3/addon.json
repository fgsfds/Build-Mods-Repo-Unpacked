For a long time we\u0027ve been thinking of how to preserve the atmosphere of this game loved by all of us, but at the same time to extend the existing limits, bring up new gameplay and experience. This time we\u0027ve gone far beyond simple fan map-making and are going to prove to you that Blood is not this hopeless even without source code. From the beginning BAITD was aimed at expanding gameplay, it can\u0027t be limited by common gameplay borders, so here you\u0027re going to see a lot of new features."
