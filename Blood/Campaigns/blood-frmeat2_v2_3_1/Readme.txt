THANKS : The Blood community in general and the-postmortem forums in particular,
because I wouldn't have had the motivation to make this add on if such a thing
didn't exist.
Keep playing Blood and enjoy it, spread the love of that game and keep the flame
burning. Special thanks to Daedalus for his help with some mapedit questions
and other I forgot. 

Crudux Cruo ! Kill everyone !
