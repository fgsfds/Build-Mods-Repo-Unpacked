Betting is a risky business, especially when there is a corrupt rat lurking in your favorite team. That's what happened to our hero: Canadian hockey player Adam Ace received a tempting offer to drain the final match of the World Cup in exchange for eternal life and sold his incorruptible soul to the well-known Cabal sect. What does sports have to do with it, you ask? The thing is that tired of immortality and endless wanderings, Caleb found an outlet in sports betting and put all his fortune accumulated over a long time spent under the wing of fortune and a unique flair for victory on the above-mentioned unfortunate national team. This leads to another question: what about the Bondage of this? The answer is immediately revealed - knowing that Caleb will not forgive Ace for such a setup of the maple leaf country (and in fact the loss of money), the goal of the distraught fanatics who lost their great and powerful, to track down, find and destroy our dead man, so to speak, for bait."
