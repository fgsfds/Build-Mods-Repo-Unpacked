Misc. author info      : Founder and owner of Blood Hispano
Other patches I've made: none. This is the first one
Description            : I was exploring the Cryptic Passage (CP)
			 retail maps to learn how they were made, and
			 I thought the maps could look better.
			 Also, I found some wrong effects that are
			 annoying, so I decided to fix the original
			 work.
			 Basically, PCP keeps the original level
			 design and gameplay, but improves texturing,
			 fixes mapping errors and lighting (very, very
			 slightly touches in this regard). You can say
			 this is a curated version of CP.
			 If you want to play an improved version of
			 Cryptic Passage, say no more: get this patch!
