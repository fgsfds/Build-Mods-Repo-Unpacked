BLOOD: TRAUMA THERAPY V.2

	ABOUT

BLOOD: TRAUMY THERAPY V.2 is a free fanmade add-on for Blood. It's not for sale and not a commercial product.


	INSTALLATION

Copy the content of this zip-file to your blood folder and follow the installation guide in the Batch-File.
Use "install.bat" for installation. It works on windows an DOS.

To install the sound-add-on for the phantasms just follow the installer.

Everything is 100% vanilla (except new textures, sounds, voxels) so it works in DOS, NBlood, BloodGDX and Raze. If you are playing in DOS it would be wise to raise the memory limit to at least 128MB. This episode is very memory-demanding.
So please don't ask me to make it Fresh Supply-compatible. I would have to rebuild most of the levels and that's a compromise I'm not willing to make.

This package of episode I and II is incompatible with version 1 and version 1.1 due to the change in maps and tiles.

The level design in 'Trauma Therapy' depends on using voxels. So turning them off will ruin your experience.


	INSTALL NOTES

Please use the "install.bat" for installing and uninstalling features.
I added two music tracks with a copyright. These can be added separately by option [5] in the installer.

The amount of the Phantasms in some levels is really high. Due to the sound handling in the Build-Engine some sounds (e.g. from Phantasms) can overlap and
create a sound buildup which can be a little "unnerving". So, for those people I made a little modification which changes the spot-sound, the attack-sound
and the projectile-hit-sound of the Phantasms. This modification is deliberately optional. To activate it just open the installer and choose the option [3].


	CHANGELOG V.2

	-fixed some DOS-related sprite clipping in bigger set pieces (EP I)
	-re-designed some areas (EP I)
	-added more plot context in some levels (EP I)
	-fixed teleporter crash on TT09 in NBlood (EP I)
	-full new episode constructed (EP II)

	KNOWN BUGS V.2

	I. NBlood

	- Panning ceiling textures are moving in the opposite direction (bug is reported to the NBlood development community, already fixed in Raze)
	 -> I optimized the the last level to display the skybox correctly in NBlood. In DOS it will look weird.

	II. DOS

	- Runs fine (except the skybox in the last level)

	III. BuildGDX

	- Some sounds wont play (I don't now why)
	- The polyGDX-Renderer could cause some trouble with the custom skyboxes. So I recommend using classic or polymost
	- Skybox errors due to moving tiles. (for example in tt25.map)

	IV. Raze

	- Some sound won't play (I don't now why)
	- Moving sectors (like path sectors) will not move. You won't be able to finish some levels or the logic of the level is broken.
	- A lot of stacking errors, looks ugly
	- Skybox errors due to moving tiles. (for example in tt25.map)


-> So I do (at the moment) not recommend using Raze. BuildGDX can run it but some rooms will look weird.

-> Recommendation: use DOS or NBlood
