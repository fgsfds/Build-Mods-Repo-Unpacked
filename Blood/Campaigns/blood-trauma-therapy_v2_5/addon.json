He is tormented by horrid dreams and visions that are haunting him and he has trouble distinguishing reality from dream. Awaking one day in hospital having no idea how he got there he sees only one solution to his agony. He has to find the three vessels of Tchernobog\u0027s Aura to resurrect him and kill him for the last time in hope of finding peace and rest."
