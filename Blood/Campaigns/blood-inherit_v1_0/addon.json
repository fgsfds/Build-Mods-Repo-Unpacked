The power and rage released by Caleb while fighting the Dreaming god was partly absorbed, and had allowed Tchernobog to lay dormant gathering energy to follow on with His plan to open the Gateway- the connection between the realms of the living and the damned. Would Caleb be able to stop the revived Daemon Tchernobog? Contains a total of 3 episodes."
