***************************************

Part I. Introduction

***************************************

Need a little help? No problem! This is a full walkthrough for Death Wish. You will have to forgive me if the writing sounds a little mechanical - I removed all unnecessary contractions so it would translate more easily. 

I know some people like to find the secrets on their own so I have split this walkthrough into 2 parts, the first of which contains no information on locating the secrets and secret levels. Neither of these list the location of the journal Tomes.

Walkthrough A is for people who are a little confused on which direction to travel, need a little guidance, or a couple hints on how best to proceed. Walkthrough A includes sections on the secret levels, but no information on how to reach them. Walkthrough A contains no details in the descriptions of the "transition" levels (the levels that directly follow secret levels and transition back into the main campaign) that will reveal the mission in which the secret levels are located.

Walkthrough B is for those who could use a few secrets (and super secrets) to help them get through a tough level or who just cannot seem to find the secret levels despite their best efforts.

All information in Walkthrough A is included in Walkthrough B. 

** THIS WALKTHROUGH WAS CREATED FOR MEDIUM DIFFICULTY AKA "LIGHTLY BROILED." SOME MONSTER AND ITEM PLACEMENT VARIES WITH CHANGES IN DIFFICULTY. THIS GUIDE DOES NOT SHOW THE ONE AND ONLY WAY TO COMPLETE LEVELS — THE USE OF TNT-JUMPING, JUMP BOOTS, ETC. WILL ALLOW YOU TO COMPLETE SOME MISSIONS BY SKIPPING KEYS OR EVEN ENTIRE SECTIONS OF THE MAP. **

To clarify:
Cultist = Shotgun Cultist, although "various Cultists" means a mix of the 4 types
Fanatic = Tommy Gun Cultist
Zealot = Tesla Cannon Cultist
Acolytes = TNT/Dynamite Only Cultist
Priest = Red Cultist that becomes a Beast
Butcher = Bloated Butcher aka Fat Zombie

Good luck!

********** EPISODE 1: IN COLD BLOOD **********




<<< E1M1: Home Sweet Home >>>

Go around the house’s interior collecting all the ammo, including behind the house to get more explosives. When you approach the front gate, a cart with monsters in tow will arrive. Follow the direction from which the cart arrived and cross the bridge. You will come to another, longer bridge. If you want some more Shotgun ammo early you can run across and grab it (you will be returning there once you have the Spider Key). To continue, ignore the long bridge and go through the dark cave. Continue into the lit areas of the cave until you reach an elevator. Once at the bottom of the elevator, continue forward until you get the Spider Key. Be careful of the Zombies hiding in the darkened areas down there. Once you have the Key you will want to backtrack completely out of the cave areas to the original long bridge. Head across the long bridge and grab the Shotgun ammo if you did not earlier. Open the door. 

Ahead you will fall through the false floor and land in the blood river. What a nasty trick! There are many Gill Beasts here, but if you have skill to take them out without getting seriously wounded, you will find that several of them will drop health and are worth killing. If you are not good against Gill Beasts get out of the water quickly and jump across the pond using the platforms as much as you can. Go through the portal next and kill some Cultists after going to the other side. Make sure to grab the Tesla Cannons the Zealots drop since you will need it for the next battle. Enter the area with your destroyed home and defeat the monsters that appear, using the Tesla Cannon on the Stone Gargoyle. Grab the Key that appears at the top of the house when the Stone Gargoyle dies. Go back where you came from to find that some Zombies have appeared out of the 2nd portal (not the one leading to the blood river). Enter this portal and use your Key to open the door. Hop into the blood pool to get the Eye Key. Open the gate with your Eye Key and head outside to the final area.



<<< E1M2: Lost Highway >>>

Head out of the forest and cross the road (avoiding the truck to the left) into the woods. There are some hidden Gill Beasts in here so watch out. On the other side of the woods is a tunnel. If you run far enough into the tunnel a truck will come barreling through, killing everything in its path — you will need to run back into the woods or stay flat up against the rocky wall to avoid it. Open the gate and make your way across the swampy area to the next road. On this road a deadly car will continuously drive back and forth, so keep your wits about you. This car will kill friend and foe alike so feel free to lure enemies into its path. Hit the switch in the guard tower to rotate the concrete bridge. The room across the bridge is crawling with Cultists who will make short work of you if you dash in. Try luring them outside or toss in a bit of dynamite. There is a barred gate here that is closed. If you have the means, you may want to kill the Hell Hound behind the bars before you raise them. To raise the bars, head up the spiral stairs and hit the switch. Jump into the cart and hit the switch to send it flying down the tunnel. Ignore the explosions - they will not hurt you if you remain in place inside the cart while it is moving. Head up the waterfall and move through the woods until you see a Fanatic. Continue through the woods to the next road. 

The Cultists have set up a roadblock with boxes and a truck. Alternate fire for the Flare gun works especially well here. Past the little red-lit tunnel a gate will open releasing Hell Hounds. You may want to lay some more Proximity Mines as you will waste a lot of precious gun ammo defeating them. After defeating the enemies near the destroyed ramp, head into the small control room at ground level lit up with orange lights, looking out for hidden Cultists along the way. One of the barrels near the control room entrance will explode and release several Choking Hands if you get close, but you can use TNT to destroy them first. After the barrels head to the right of the split and mow down the Fanatics. Get the Key down the hallway then return to hit the switch, revealing the Dagger Key. Grab the Dagger Key and run out of the control room immediately before the outer door closes. Outside, new forces have arrived, and you will need to get through them to reach the guard tower near the road block. Hit the switch at the top of the tower to raise the final bridge. There’s a switch in the toll booth you will need to toggle before the final doorway opens. Head across the bridge to the next mission.



<<< E1M3: Firebelly >>>

Move through the tunnel and go outside. Go down the walkway alongside the water until you reach the next tunnel. Move forward until the Hell Hound sees you, then drop some Proximity Mines to weaken it before you start firing shells or bullets. Continue with a long-range weapon in hand to fight the enemies on the far side of the bridge. Watch out for the Cultist to the right hiding behind the guard tower. Head up the dark passage to the house. The right side of the house has some ammo in a box you will want to grab. On the far side of the house is a stone pillar that requires the Fire Key. Ignore it for now, and head to the roof for the Skull Key. Get the Key and head inside the house. A Cultist is hiding in there so be careful. Open the basement door, go down the steps, and hop in the water. Once you emerge from the water you will find that you have been transported to The Dark Side, where everything is floating on a lava river. 

The lava will kill you instantly so watch where you jump. Before you get to the Fire Key there is a small rock tunnel you must go through. As you move along you will see the Fire Key on your right atop the elevated platform. Jump up to grab it, then immediately continue ahead or duck down in the nearby boat to avoid the fireballs. Keep going to the end and you will be able to see the portal back to the original house behind a barrier. There is a Hell Hound hiding around the corner. The Return Portal’s barrier requires the Dagger key. Head into the Lava Temple behind the barrier. The doors to the left lead back outside where a blue light orbits a glowing orb. Follow the path of the orbiting light, which is following an invisible path that you can walk across (use 2D map mode here to make it easier). Take the Spider key and go back to the Lava Temple lobby. Go through the other set of doors and blow up the nearby wall. Enter through the hole and continue along the path until you eventually reach the Dagger Key. After adding it to your collection go back to the Dagger Key barrier and move though the Return Portal behind it, which will take you back to the icy house. 

Go to the stone pillar behind the house and use your Fire Key. Cross the platforms that rise and continue into the gated arena building. Go through the door on the right. Some Cultists are waiting for you in the middle of the next hallway, so come around the corner with your gun blazing or throw some explosives ahead of you. Continue down the hall and into the arena. If you have a Life Leech you may want to use its alternate fire here to help thin the crowd. Save your Shotgun ammo for the Spiders, as they will not take much damage from TNT. This is a great place to use spare Proximity Mines if you normally cannot find a use for them. When you have killed enough the spectators will explode and you will be able to head to The Abyss.




<<< E1M4: The Abyss >>>

Jump into the water-filled opening and swim ahead. When you pop out of the water in the next area you will see the entrance to the Abyss. Head through the door to the stairwell. Go down the stairs until you reach a structure with windows. This is the church. Go around to the side of the building and shoot the Cultists through the windows. There is a Fanatic in there, too, so you may want to toss in some explosives. Once inside, go into the first door on the right which leads to the supply room. Grab all the items inside, including the first of 3 Tomes that will reveal the Eye Key. The next door leads to the nave and chancel of the church. The church nave is full of enemies. You may want to alert them to your presence with some gunfire, then exit back outside to use the door as a bottleneck. Grab the 2nd Tome sitting on the pulpit to the right of the cross. There is a passageway near the pipe organ leading to an area with a Life Essence. Grabbing it will summon Zombies so only do so if you need health more than ammo. This also leads to the the back entrance of the church's 2nd area. Go through here (watch out for the painting that a Choking Hand jumps through) and kill the Choking Hands that run towards you. Straight ahead is the doorway from the front entrance. On the sides of the hallway are 2 rooms. One has a bookcase and some Cultists. The other room has a Fanatic and the final Tome. Grab the Tome and the stained glass window behind the cross will shatter. The area behind the broken window has the Eye Key. Grab the Key and head out of the church completely to get back to the giant staircase. Head to the bottom of the stairs and ride the elevator down. Hop through the hole and you will be on the floor 2. 

Go out the main door and kill the Cultist. Dive into the bloody river and fight the 2 Gill Beasts. Swim in the direction they came from until you reach a new area. Above the surface you will see Tchernobog waiting. Get near him and he will transform into a cluster of Spiders. Hop back into the river where the Spiders will follow you to their doom. Keep swimming until you see a small opening with bubbles around it. Get out of the river here and continue until you get the Key. Return to where Tchernobog transformed. Go through the door and head down to floor 3. Get an explosive weapon ready. As soon as you open the door Zombies will flood the room, and there is no space to jump over them. Kill enough and a rock wall will open. Three colored lights will lead to 3 passageways. Follow the blue light to the entrance on the right to proceed to the next mission.




<<< E1M5: Jigsaw >>>

Go to the door where Tchernobog exited and open it with a Shotgun in hand. A Phantasm will burst out, and you will want to kill it as it will be a big nuisance. Continue through the door and go right to another door. Head down the hallway and hit the switch at the end, which will fill up the toilet on the other side of the wall. Go to the toilet and grab the Skull Key. You will hear a shattering noise, which is a compartment on the white wall of the main area breaking open revealing several Choking Hands. Kill the Choking Hands and hit the switch near the bathtub. The bathtub will fill with blood, which will drain the vat of blood located on the opposite side of the wall. Go to the vat and hop down. Crawl through the passage and hit the switch. The white wall where the Choking Hands appeared will now start moving backward, opening up a new area. Go to the new area and grab the Key behind the white wall. Head to the safe, open it, grab the final Key for the area, and exit through the big metal door. Go outside and head around to the back of the building. You will come to a set of stairs leading to a control room. Use an explosive to clear the control room of a hiding Fanatic and hit the switch inside. Look out the window and you will see a door opening. There are some TNT barrels down there that will kill most of the enemies, so you may want to try firing some explosives down there. Head through the new opening until you reach the bomb room. You will need to hit all 4 switches and grab the Fire Key to escape before time runs out. When time dissipates the bomb will explode, killing anything in the room (the explosions will go no further than the room). If you damage the bomb by accident it will go off immediately so aim carefully when fighting. 

Move forward and kill the Gill Beast to your right. When you approach the bridge Tchernobog will destroy it with explosions, so do not try to run across. Go down the passage whence the Gill Beast came until you come to the open waterfall area. Continue up the earthen stairway until you reach the area with some spiderwebs. There is a small hole on the right with some ammo inside. You may move through the passage and jump over to where Tchernobog was standing earlier. If the bridge has not blown up yet it will when you get close, so watch out. Move past the eye door to the big spiderweb. Near the big spiderweb there is a hole containing several Spiders and a Guns Akimbo with Shotgun ammo. You can grab this at any time since this area of the mission is always available from this point, but you may want to do it now. Head around the curve and jump into the Spider nest. When you grab the Spider Key at the end, Spiders will appear to defend the nest, including a Mother Spider who will make more. If you still have Guns Akimbo, try using alternate fire Shotgun blasts to knock the Mother Spider off a ledge to her doom. You do not have to kill any of them, so if you are low on ammo and high on health try running through them. Return to the Eye Door and kill the 2 Cultists standing right behind it. Enter the door straight ahead and grab the Flares located outside. If you go right instead you’ll find a caved-in section with a single Zombie that drops a Life Essence. The final door leads to the next key. The dangling body will burst with Spiders if you get close, so blow it up beforehand. Grab the Dagger Key at the end of the passage and leave the Eye Door area. Go to the left of the wall where the Spider nest is located. You need to raise the platform so you can cross. If you want to go back just use a switch a by the moving platform to get yourself back to the Dagger Door. Once through the Dagger Door you can head right to continue to the next mission. If you want Super Armor (and a challenge), head to the door straight ahead. Grab the armor at the end of the passage. When you come back around the corner you will find the hallway flooded with Zombies. Go through the Exit door to go to the next mission.




<<< E1M6: What Lies Beneath >>>

As you come through the opening doors, unload some long-range ammo on the Cultists before they ride close enough to fire on you. There are Hell Hounds running around this outside area, too. Run up to the facility and fight your way into the guard tower where you will find a bunch of Tommy Gun ammo and a Skull Key to access the main building. You can also skip this key and enter the main building on the left side by shooting out the windows to the Eye Key room. Inside the main building you’ll need to grab the Eye Key through the only unlocked door. Outside the door, Zombies have filled the hallway. Access the medical lab at the end of the hall with your Eye Key. Grab the Dagger Key inside (watch out for the Choking Hand), the Tesla Cannon, and the Doctor's Bag from the metal medical supply closet. Exit the lab and kill more Zombies. Go through the Dagger Door and head underground to the saucer. 

Step into the light and you will appear inside the ship. Open the door (many Choking Hands are inside) and get the Spider Key. Watch out for the Gill Beast that appears in the saucer and head back out. Return to the main hallway in the building and go through the last remaining door. You will head underground again. There is some ammo to the left by the barrels and a long passage to the right. Go past the Spiders and clear out the passage and the boiler room. Grab the Fire Key and hit the switch on the boiler. The boiler will overheat and explode very soon so run past the rising Zombies and get back to the upper floor via the stairs. When the explosions have stopped, run through the opening the explosions created in the rock wall and continue through the dark. Defeat all the creatures in the flashing red area (and there are quite a few - save ammo for the Mother Spider), and be sure to stand away from the pillar of flesh when you kill the Mother Spider since explosions will go off. Drop into the hole behind the flesh pillar and fall into the water. Climb out onto the concrete and go up the stairs to the end of the mission.




<<< E1M7: Urban Decay >>>

Use the barrel to jump up on the wall and walk along the ledge to the area with the truck. Kill the Cultist and the truck will move forward allowing you to get the Dagger Key on the ground behind it. Go back to where you started. Ignore the stairs and head into the apartment building. Tchernobog will transform into a large brood of Rats if you get close, so toss some TNT his way. Go into the first apartment with blue carpeting and watch out for the Zombie behind the door. Get the health in the kitchen if you need it (you will be returning to this apartment) as well as ammo and armor from the bedroom closet. Kill the Zombie hiding in the bathroom and a wall will open up in the bedroom, letting you pass into the blue apartment. There are a slew of Zombies beyond the bedroom door so be ready. Kill the Butcher in the kitchen for the Skull Key and head back out of the apartment building (watch out for the Phantasm that appears in the red apartment after killing the Butcher). Go up the stairs in the starting area and kill the Fanatic in the elevator booth. Hit the switch and bring the elevator down, which will be carrying 2 Cultists. Ride up the elevator and clear out the office. Take your time and clear out the office slowly - there are Cultists hidden in some of the cubicles. Get the Fire Key from a Butcher in the women's bathroom. The other bathroom has a Flare gun. Enter the manager's office and immediately blast the Zealot with gunfire before he can get a shot off. Break the large window in his office and jump to the closest rooftop straight ahead. This is a very tricky jump, and any misstep will send you plummeting to your death. Once outside, navigate over to the window of another apartment building and break in. A Gargoyle will break into the bedroom so you may want your Tesla Cannon handy. Jump out the window of the bathroom (where a Zombie is hiding) onto a rooftop. Look at the blinking green finance sign and turn left - you will see an office you will be visiting later with some baddies in it. You can try to take them out early by breaking the window furthest to the left and tossing some explosives up there. Look at the blinking green finance sign and turn right - you will see the finance building and an entrance. 

Jump down to the financial building and ride the elevator to the ground floor. Head over to the exit sign and go left. There is some ammo in the first bathroom. The dark bathroom has a Doctor’s Bag if you need it, but 2 Phantasms will appear as soon as you pick it up. Activate the elevator at the end of the hall, which is full of Zombies. A Spray Can or Proximity Mines may be useful here. Ride the elevator up and kill the Cultists if you did not earlier. Get the Key in the last cubicle. A green Cultist is now blocking the elevator. If you shoot or get near him he will blow up the entire floor and the next rooftop, so only do it if you are fast. Take the same route as before back down to the ground floor of the finance building. Zombies will break through the exit doors when you approach. Head out into the parking lot and get ready for a big fight. Go to the top of the tower on the border wall and grab the Eye Key. Several Zealots will appear when the window breaks on the previous building. Get back inside the building and go left. Bring the elevator down (it has a Butcher and a Hell Hound) and ride up to the end of the mission.



<<< E1M8: Vertigo >>>

Kill the Cultist at the top of the elevator. Zombies will start breaking out of their statues, but if you have explosives you can kill them before they break out. After a certain amount of time has passed the doors to the next area will open. When all the Hounds have perished in this starting section a doorway will appear. Head to the rooftops. There are a bunch of enemies up here, but you will have to kill the Stone Gargoyle to end the episode. There are some helpful guns around the bigger buildings if you run low on ammo. Save up your Tesla shots for the Stone Gargoyle. 




<<< E1M9: Spooky World (Secret Level) >>>

Start by running up the stairs into the ticket line area. Both ticket booths have some ammo so be sure to go into those. Fight your way to Spooky World's crossroads with the spinning hologram. The snack stands both have good items, so be sure to grab them all. Straight ahead is the entrance to the final section, but you will need all 4 of the Keys placed around the park first. The order in which you obtain them is irrelevant. Each attraction has 1 Key.

Pandemonium Shadow Show:
Head down the hallway and keep going straight until you get the ammo following the other entrance to the theater. Grab the Fire Key on the stage and mow down the enemies. Move along the wall until you find your way out or wait for the curtain to ascend. Walk down the long hallway if you don’t want to wait for the curtain which leads to the starting area.

Miskatonic Station:
The main pathway to this area is blocked with a gate. You will have to break the vent in the scream burger stand to reach this area. Once inside, walk toward the bridges but wait for the train to pass by first. You will find the Spider Key on the upper floor of the gift shop.

Happy-Go-PuKey:
The Eye Key is on the furthest platform. If you fall in, avoid the Gill Beasts and use the stairs near the waterfall to escape. Enemies will appear at the top of the stairs after you grab the Key.

River Ride of Terror:
Kill everyone in the line for the ride - it will make your return much easier (especially if you accidentally fall in the water). Get in the river boat and hit the switch. Prepare for several enemies who will fire on the boat as it moves. Grab the Dagger Key at the end of the ride and return to the boat. Hitting the switch again will make it return.

Now that you have all the Keys, head to the entrance to the final section: The House of Horrors. Kill the Fanatics and activate the 4 switches. There is a small army behind the gate that drops so ready your explosives. Run through the forest with the Gargoyles and you will come to the lines for the House of Horrors. Fight your way into the attraction (Flare gun fire works well here) and press on the door to descend. There is a Guns Akimbo on top of one of the wooden shelves you may want to get before clicking on the door. At the bottom you will have to mow down some Zombies and several Cultists in the room that follows which contains the ride carts. Head down the hallway and watch out for the Phantasm who bursts through the window. Keep moving along the ride's metal railway until you reach the blue ballroom. Grab the Key in the middle of the room and fight off the horde that appears. The curtains will eventually rise allowing you to move on after the Stone Gargoyle is dead. Go to the ramp leading upwards and watch out for the Hell Hound around the corner. Continue through the rest of the ride and you will end up back at the ride's seating area with the carts. Go through the Moon Door and destroy the wall near the clock. Go through the hole, turn right, duck under the wooden panel, and open the door to complete the mission. 




<<< E1M10: Ring of Fire (Transition Level, Returns you to E1M4) >>>

Head down the blue passage and go through the door. Grab the Shotgun and continue through the second door. The hallway that follows is packed with Zombies so get your explosives ready. Keep moving along to the large outdoor space surrounded by flames. There are a lot of Hell Hounds so keep moving. Defeat all the creatures to move on to the next mission.




<<< E1M11: Shudder Island (Secret Level) >>>

Kill the guard to get the key so you can open your cell. Go into the manager area to the left and hit the switch to open the elevator up at the opposite end of the hallway. Head to the end of the hall, hit the switch on the wall to the right to unlock the elevator, and head down. Proceed down the stairs to the bottom floor, passing by an elevator that requires 3 keys. Once outside in the rain, look left toward some barrels. Destroy them to blow up the wall. Inside, go right to the room with the Dagger Key. The other pathway leads to a rocky hole in the wall. Follow it into the flooded area and get the Spider Key. Return outdoors. Enter the Dagger Door by the boat. This structure has a low and high path. Take the high path to get to the Fire Key. Exit the structure through the glass window to reach the area on the other side of the wall. Shoot the barrels along the wall to create an opening. Head out to the beach for Eye Key. Return to the 3-Key Elevator. Go down, grab the Moon Key, and return to the boat outdoors. Use the boat’s steering wheel to complete the mission.




<<< E1M12: Old Sins (Transition Level, Returns you to E1M6) >>>

Ascend to the top of the rocks and enter the church on the left side through the window. Inside there are some Cultists guarding Life Essences. Exit the church area and go down the long passage. Take the elevator up at the end of the long passage and go past the spiderwebs and Eye Door into an ice-filled room. Get the Eye Key past this room and then backtrack. Before you can get back to the Eye Door a gate will rise up, forcing you into a short battle. When the gate goes back down you can enter the Eye Door. Head down the left passage and grab the Dagger Key. Return to the elevated platform, cross it, and then enter the Dagger Door. Go straight ahead for Super Armor and an enemy assault or go right to exit the mission.




********** EPISODE 2: Scar Trek **********




<<< E2M1: Armada >>>

Stay still while the cart is in motion then hop onto the vessel (which I will refer to as "ships") when the cart stops. This is Ship A. Go through the door to the right and clear the area. Go through the door straight across from the one you used to enter Ship A and wait for the trailing ship to arrive. When it does the gate will come down and Zombies will run out. If you are skilled you can bomb a few of them with TNT before the ship arrives. Once a few have died the main cabin will open up allowing you to get the Skull Key. Go back into Ship A and take the door on the left. Activate the cannon and return to the trailing ship. The ship that you fired on will have come close enough to enter. Grab the Eye Key from inside and go back to where you first hopped off your original cart. Walk across the chain connectors to the mini ship. Ignore the cannon and move to the rear of Ship B. You will see a switch that will lower the back wall. Press it and return to the mini ship. Rotate the cannon using your Eye Key FIRST, then fire the cannon to make a path into Ship B. You can not blow up the wall before activating the cannon. Clear the inside of Ship B. The door to exit Ship B will open when you get near it, and there are many Zombies waiting for a chance to get inside. Use explosives here to conserve ammo or draw them inside and dodge them. Move straight across the chains to the head of the caravan. Hop in the little cart and drive over to the giant Ship C. 

Starting from where you entered, go to the first door on the left. Head down the hallway and kill the Butcher in the bathroom for the Fire Key. Return. Starting from where you entered, go to the door on the right. Clear the navigation room and grab the Spider Key. Starting from where you entered, go to the furthest door to the left. When you run down the walkway a Fanatic will come along on your right and start firing. Unload a Shotgun blast on him and move forward. Go through the door ahead and take out the baddies. As soon as you access the Spider Key locked panel the wall to the left will shoot up revealing several enemies. You will have to act fast to avoid the TNT being thrown. Exit through the rear door of Ship C and fire the giant cannon to end the mission.




<<< E2M2: Out to Launch >>>

Move until you can see the wrecked ship. Go right and grab the Skull Key inside the ship buried in sand. Head through the destroyed ship to the next outdoor area. Use the Key to unlock the cannon on the mini ship ahead. While the cannon rotates, fire it to destroy the wall blocking the path of the rocket cart. Once the wall is destroyed, activate the rocket cart to send it careening down the channel. The ensuing explosion should wipe out the wealth of enemies in the passage, as well as destroy a wall near the end. Jump through the broken section of wall and you will come to an open area with stairs and a green, toxic pool. You can ignore the Butchers for now - you will be back to enter the garage behind them. Go up the stairs and hit the switch in the Garage Access Area to open the garage door. Looking out the window, you will see a band of Zombies have been released. Since there are so many you may want to employ explosives or your Spray Can. Enter the garage. There is some ammo inside the canister carrier. Go through the door and open the gate leading to the elevator. Head up and you will find yourself in the Space Center. 

Note the colored lines on the floor as they correspond to the labels listed on the wall. Head to the first door on the left (the Bathroom). Grab the ammo and hop into the upper vent, which will lead to the Supply Room. When you exit the Supply Room there will be enemies on you immediate left, so fire away. Head to the control room. Clear out the enemies and grab the Eye Key. Take the space center elevator out in the hallway to the launch bay at ground level or just jump out the control room window (you will take some damage). Go past the rocket to the little building beneath the rocks. Grab the Fire Key in the building under the mountainside and open the Fire panel to get a Tommy Gun. Press the Eye switch to unlock the rocket clamps. Press the 2 switches at the base of the rocket to move the clamps in preparation for launch. Return to the Space Center control room and hit the switch to open the shuttle doors. Follow the red line on the floor to the shuttle. Drop down the ladder move along until you get to the elevator. Kill the Cultist riding it and hop in. It will rise back up into the shuttle on its own. Hit the switch and you will be on your way to the heavens!




<<< E2M3: Mothership >>>

Head out of the shuttle into the ship bay. Ride the elevator up and go to the control panel to open shuttle 2. Break the canister next to the controls for some shells. When shuttle 2 opens grab the Key inside and return to the upper area to open the gateway out of the ship bay. You will enter the operations hub, or "OPS”, and there are a number of ways to go from here. The following method will make sure you are always stocked up with supplies. Go to the armory, grab what you can carry, and head back to OPS. It will be crawling with monsters so ready any explosives you have available. They will pour of out of the open door so make sure you do not blow yourself up. Clear out OPS and go to the cargo bay. In the cargo bay you will need to jump on the boxes to reach the vent system. Hop in and go right. Keep going until you end up in the room with the swinging chains. Continue to the swinging chain room. Get the Eye Key and fight off the monsters. Return to OPS. 

Head towards the crew quarters. Kill the Gargoyles in the corridor and go to the next door. Continue through the door to the rotating hub, which we will call “Spin Hub”. Enter the door marked CREW. Grab the Dagger Key and wait for the foes to break out of the sleep pods (the door you came through will be locked until they all appear). You can lay Remote or Proximity Mines on the pods ahead of time to get them as soon as they appear. Return to Spin Hub. 

Enter the door marked POD. You will see the space pod on the right. This room connects to the armory so if you need to restock do it now. Get in the space pod and hit the switch to send it floating around the mothership to the mini ship bay that’s connected to the Crew room. Once the pod door opens hop out before it explodes. Grab the Spider Key and head straight back to Spin Hub. At this point you will be able to open a Spider Door by the shuttle bay control panel from the beginning of the mission. You may want to do this now as time will be short after getting the Moon Key.

Enter the door marked CORE. Some Choking Hands will drop from a ceiling grate so look out. You will enter a room full of machinery. Head into the darkened core control room. Hit the 3 switches in order from left to right. Instructions on how to escape the self destruct sequence will be displayed. Push the 2 white pillars and grab the Moon Key. When you do, the self destruct will begin. Immediately run to Spin Hub, then to the POD room, then through the Armory room, then to OPS, then to the shuttle bay control panel. The button for shuttle 3 should be lit up in blue. Press the button and hop down to shuttle 3 to escape.




<<< E2M4: Weird Science >>>

Jump from your ship into the sea. Swim to the right of the cliff where Tchernobog waits and kill the Cultist in the boat. A Gill Beast will be summoned while you are making you are way over to the boat so be ready. Swim to the dock and lure the Hell Hound near the Flare gun into the water. Grab the supplies and Diving Suit then head up to the top of the cliff on the big lift. Grab the ammo by the corpse and walk towards Tchernobog. Dodge the fireballs, after which the doors to the castle will open releasing various Cultist types. Enter the castle and you will be in an area we will call the Statue Hall.

If you destroy the hand statue a Life Seed will appear along with many Choking Hands, so use an explosive. Jump in the water to get the Fire Key. Get out of the water and go to the Fire Door. Continue to the library where you will find a Tome. When you pick it up a hidden entrance will appear to the dungeon. Head down the spiral stairs, eliminating the Acolytes on your way. At the bottom of the stairs you need to kill the Hell Hounds quickly. Use Tesla ammo if you have it. Enter the earthen, cobwebbed area to get the Spider Key for entering the torture chamber. Go to the torture chamber. Go up the staircase to the balcony. Grab the Skull Key and fall into the water. Climb out before the Gill Beasts can hurt you.

Before entering the ghost hall through the back entrance you may want to shoot out some of the windows from outside and throw some TNT into the dining room - it is full of enemies. Enter the rear entrance to the ghost hall. Do not get near the ghost in the hall or a Phantasm will appear. The door to the right has some Spirit Armor, which you will want to grab. The doors on the left lead to the dining room. Mow down the Cultists to the left to obtain the Eye Key. Head back out the Fire Door toward the statue hall and go left. Open the gate with the Eye Key and go up the ramps. Continue across the wooden bridge to the storm tower and grab the Moon Key at the summit. Head back to the Moon Door (near the Fire Door) and continue past it to the mission’s end.




<<< E2M5: The Grapes of Wraith >>>

Move forward and clear out the red chapel area. There are several Fanatics and Cultists in the chapel so beware. In the next room you will see the Skull door on the left and exits to the right and straight ahead. Go right and kill the Cultist outside. Keep going past the dark hallway back outside and you will find the Skull Key. Use it to open the Skull Door, being careful not to get sliced by the Phantasm waiting just beyond. The next room has a forklift. Use the switch on it to move the lift toward the window, then use the lift as a stepladder to reach the window ledge. Go outside the open window near where the forklift stopped and through the silo to a large outdoor area with some blue lights. Grab the Eye Key from the Zealot and return inside. You can now access the upper walkway area from where Fanatics were firing at you earlier. Proceed through several doors. Shoot the barrel in the storage room and it will blow open a passage to the next section. 

To the left are some enemies and a moss-covered temple. You will be going to the right through a cavelike area first. At the end of the cave will be a hole in the wall that gives access to a sewage tunnel. Head into the sewage (with a powerful weapon handy for the Gill Beasts) and you will come to a break in the pipe ceiling. Emerge from the opening and you will find yourself in the vineyard. Some enemies will be coming down the slope to attack you. At the top of the hill is the winery. The Dagger Key is on the long tasting table on the inside-left, but you will have to plow through some serious resistance before you can reach it safely. Now that you have the Dagger Key, return to the moss-covered temple and enter it. Head right out of the entrance area into the orange-lit room. Turn left and press on the lion slab to lower it. Descend to the bottom of the shaft to the next orange room. Proceed to the green water pool and grab the Fire Key. Return to the main entrance and head up the opposite passageway with the stairs. Use the Fire Key on the switch at the top of the stairs to open the stone gateway across the wooden bridge. Return to the main entrance and cross the bridge. Open the doors past the gateway and continue to the end of the mission. 




<<< E2M6: Deep-Sixed >>>

You will come to a large structure resembling an open mouth. Hit the switch inside to open the doorway to the cellar directly behind it. Near the skylight of the cellar's central pillar is a hidden switch. Shoot it to open the middle pillar which hides Reflective Shots. From the cellar entrance there are several paths leading to the location of 5 Black Chests that you will need to open the large pink door. Here are the locations:

* This task can be done out of order *
1. Face the pink door. Head left and go forward until you reach a room with a large bonfire in the center. A chest is on a nearby cart.

2. Face the pink door. Head left and go up a nearby slanted ramp, then take the first left into a room with 3 skylights. The chest is near the table. When you grab it Zombies will emerge from 3 passages. 

3. Face the pink door. Head left and take the first right. Go straight until the pathway curves and you come to a room with a floating head orbited by bodies. The chest is on the far end of the room. Make sure you have explosives before attempting this room, as you will have to fight off a Zombie swarm.

4. Face the pink door. Head right through the furthest passage (with the stairway). Enter the room at the end of the walkway and grab the chest inside.

5. Face the pink door. Head right through the closest passage (with the boat). Ride the boat to the little island and grab the chest. Be careful — enemies appear when you take the chest. Ride the boat back from whence you came.

Return to the pink door and walk up to it. If you have all 5 Black Chests it will open, releasing a horde of rats. Jump in the pool of water behind them and swim to the next area.

When you get outside, you will see a ghost ship, a few houses, and a lighthouse with a flashing beacon. Go to the boat dock. Enter the ghost ship through an opening adjacent to the center mast. Once inside, face the green hanging cloth. Head left and enter the upturned dining room, which is filled with enemies around every turn, rather than going to the 2nd floor. Grab the Eye Key from the back corner of the room and head to floor 2. In this bedroom you must kill the Phantasm. This will open a passage at the bed's headboard, allowing you to enter the sunken ship. Enter the water and go to the opposite end of the boat (the kitchen) where you will find the Skull Key behind a panel requiring the Eye Key for access. Backtrack to exit the sunken ship and the ghost ship. Go to the lighthouse and take the Skull Elevator to the top. Grab the Moon Key and go back down. Use the Moon Key on the other elevator, which will carry you down to the end of the mission.




<<< E2M7: Paradise Lost >>>

Paradise Lost is going to be the most challenging map you have come across in this episode. There is a lot of scenery look at but make sure you keep your eyes out for enemies, too. Walk out of the cave and continue through the crystal cavern. You will come to the entrance of a stone fortification where light is flooding out. We will refer to this as the "fort." There is some water you will be heading into flowing under the fort, and if you have some spare ammo dive down there now and take out the Gill Beasts behind the bars. Enter the fort and clear out the enemies. Drawing the Hell Hounds out into the water is useful if you are low on ammo. Go to the space behind the brown glass window and use the "water gate" switch. This opens the underwater bars. Go back out to the blue area, swim past the bars, and go left (straight ahead are some helpful supplies just outside the water surface). Come out of the water and you’ll be in a big hall with barrels along the far wall. Take the elevator in this hall up to a rooftop area with orange lighting surrounded by a pool. Go straight ahead to get the Fire Key on the pool’s rim. Return to the fort and enter the Fire Door. There is a Zealot on the other side so be ready to fire.

Go up the steps and travel until you see Tchernobog. When you get close a band of Zombies is going to crawl out of the ground. Alt fire Spray Can works wonders here. Eventually a wall behind the Zombies will lower allowing you to continue along a ledge by the blue crystal section you passed earlier, then to a new outside area with a waterfall. Be careful not to fall off. Get the Dagger Key and open the nearby gate. Return to the first floor of the the fort and go in the Dagger Door. A Choking Hand will pop out of a little vase. Ahead Tchernobog will appear again. Get close and he will turn into several enemies.  Open the gate with your Dagger Key and run into the cave ahead. There is a corpse outside that drops Guns Akimbo. Hop in the cave pool and quickly swim straight ahead until you see the surface of the water. When you emerge on the other side you will be able to see the shore to the right. Past the shore is a large area with lots of enemies and lots of room to maneuver yourself. One of the Stone Gargoyles in this wide-open area will open the gate at the far end, revealing the Spider Key and the path back to the first floor of the fort. Enter the Spider Door. Navigate through the supply room and take the Moon Key. Return to the main area (now filled with Zombies) and go through the Fire Door. Go back to the Dagger Gate you raised earlier in the mission and enter the Moon Door just past it. Jump down the hole in the ground and you will land in some water. Walk towards the light. Tchernobog will launch some fireballs at you. Keep walking ahead to the end of the mission.




<<< E2M8: The Black Tower >>>

Grab the weaponry to the left after you exit the cave and head through the rest of the forest. When you emerge from the trees you will be able to see the black tower and the battleground that lies before it. There are 2 battalions out here: One in the center that will engage you immediately and a second that will approach when you get closer to the tower. Also in the center is Tchernobog, who will summon a batch of Zombies when you get close enough to the tower. Save your Tesla ammo for the tower entrance. At the mouth of the tower (literally) there will be some fire pods and more Zombies when you get close. When you step into the center of the mouth a wall will open releasing Cerberus and some hounds. Unload your Tesla Cannon on Cerberus. If you run out of ammo, keep moving backward while firing - you will have lots of space. You can try blowing Cerberus off the cliff to his death but it is pretty tough to do. Once he's dead you will be able to enter the tower. Go around the corner and step into the glowing light. You will be transported to the tree gallery. Each tree acts as a portal to a unique area. In each area you will need to hit a skull-shaped switch. The order in which you activate them is irrelevant. Once you hit all 5 you will be able to use the floor portal in the main gallery area to exit back to the tower interior. Go to the new area that has opened up and drop down the hole to the right into sub level 1 of the tower. 

Go into the next room and pick up the Tesla Cannon on the ground. Proceed across the  invisible bridge, dodging (by hopping through) Tchernobog's fireball rings. Cross to the other side and head down the ramps in the lava filled area to tower sub level 2. Journey across sub level 2's invisible bridge to the doorway with lava falls on each side. There is a Stone Gargoyle flying up above that you will need to kill. When the Stone Gargoyle is dead, fight your way into the room with the invisible floor above a lava flow. Move around the ring-shaped hallway and hop into the glowing light. You will be transported outside of the tower where you will have to fight your way back inside. Enter the tower, head right and go up the stairs instead of heading left through the dark archway where you went last time. Take the elevator up to the tower's top floor. You will see the Fire Key as the path ends. When you grab the Fire Key the area is going to flood with monsters, so you may want to lay around some Proximity or Remote Mines beforehand. Head back to the room with the invisible floor above a lava flow on sub level 2. Enter the fire door, descend to sub level 3, and walk through the lava tunnel. The mission ends shortly after. 




<<< E2M9: Legion >>>

Walk into the cave and grab the ammo. Crawl through the rock tunnel and head right at the steps to grab some ammo at the top. There’s a switch right by the items that will raise the ledge so you can get back on the stairs. The bottom of the stairway will lead to an invisible bridge. When you are nearly on the bridge Tchernobog's specter will launch some fireballs your way. You will want to be away from the back wall when dodging them. Tchernobog will explode when you get close. Go to the next room and you will see another specter. This one will summon some Zombies. Attack them and wait for the door on the side to open. The big battle begins!

Fight the enemies that appear until Cerberus appears. Killing Cerberus will trigger the next wave of adversaries. After some time another rock will drop down releasing some more enemies and a Stone Gargoyle. Killing the Stone Gargoyle will end the mission.




<<< E2M10: Dread Faction (Secret Level) >>>

When the elevator stops, head straight ahead and take the lift up at the end of the sewer. Go around the corner and head into the rock area with a large metal gate. Go left and hit the switch to raise it, then hop into the cargo car of the underground train. Use the control panel by the sleeping Zombie then head to the back where the doors will open exposing the Skull Key. Use it to open the gate on the opposite side of the car to proceed to the storage car. Lower the elevator to the left first, bomb the Cultists riding the platform, then open the gate and head up to the kitchen. Grab the Eye Key in the kitchen and be sure to check the fridge for health. Go back down the elevator and head to the dining car through the Eye Doors. The Fire Key lies behind the next set of double doors past the dining area. Head back to the food car and open the fire door. Grab the Dagger Key and go back to the food car. Continue forward until you open the Dagger Door and reach a locked door behind 2 Zealots. Climb around the ledge and get atop the head of the train so you can jump down from the roof into the engine room. Once in the engine room, hit the 2 switches and stand on the opposite side of the room before the train crashes. Move along through the wrecked train and the sewer to the facility rail cart.

Ride it to the facility and move into the steam/disinfection room past the Phantasm. Press on the control panel to start the sequence. When you hear the chime a door will open to a large room made up of 4 pathways. At the center is a key panel where you will open up the blue, red, and white sections (in that order as you obtain a key from each area you enter). Zombies are here in enormous numbers, and will return with reinforcements each time you complete a colored section (along with Gill Beasts in some areas). Activate the blue section first with the Dagger Key you obtained earlier.

Blue:
One door leads to some supplies. The next is a small room with some cryo tubes. Hit the switch on the computer panel wall and grab the Moon Key. Return to the key panel and use the Moon Key.

Red:
One door leads to a diving suit. The next is a large room with a large cryo-water tank. Ride the elevator down then press on the computer panel at the end of the walkway. The water level will rise high enough for you to jump in without injury. Swim to the bottom and grab the Spider Key. Return to the key panel and use the Spider Key.

White:
One door leads to some supplies. The next is a small room with some cryo tubes like the blue section. Hit the switch on the wall with the danger sign to open the final pathway behind the key panel. There is a deluge of baddies in there so ready your explosives. 

At the back of the pathway the door is locked, so you will be heading into a vent near the doorway. Crawl through and blast the Zombies. Head down the elevator where you entered the train depot and get ready to take down the final wave of Zombies. Get your Napalm Launcher out for this or you could easily get trapped. Run the elevator ahead where the mission ends.  




<<< E2M11: Behemoth (Transition Level, Returns you to E2M5) >>>

Once you move across the back entrance to the castle you will have a variety of Cultists and Cerberus on your tail. Blast the Zealots if you need Tesla ammo. Cerberus will drop a Moon Key upon death. Use it to head through the Moon Door that leads to the experimental chamber. The mission ends shortly afterward.




********** EPISODE 3: WAR IS HELL **********




<<< E3M1: Whisper Peak >>>

Head out of the bathroom and journey until you reach the boathouse. Take the boat across the lake and proceed to the town. Walk along the road until you get to the Skull Key sitting next to a radio. Use it to enter the pub and head out the exit door behind the bar. Get the Eye Key and hop on the trash bin. Jump off the bin over the fence and go to the mechanic's shop across from the pub. Open the gate with the Eye Key then head up the stairs. Open the back gate, which will give you access to the rear of the building but also releases a Hell Hound (don’t waste your Flares on it). Out back you will jump into a well to get the Fire Key, giving you access to the school. 

Head into the school (the white building with a clock mounted on the front) and take the first right into classroom 100 to get some ammo before continuing. Go right at the end of the hall. Outside you will find a Black Chest. Once you touch it, head back inside and down the new dark hallway. Keep going until you reach the new area with Gill Beasts, or "normal floor." Take the first right into the goo, or "goo floor," then swim straight across to the Dagger Key. Return to normal floor and use the Dagger Key on the wall switch. Go to goo floor and enter the last doorway on the left (there is a diving suit nearby where the Gill Beast emerged). Hit the switch near the desk. There is a Gill Beast who will drop a Life Essence around the corner where the spikes are placed if you have low health and spare ammo. Return to normal floor. Head through the open mouth passage. Continue into the next mouth passage ahead to be whisked away to the end of the mission.      




<<< E3M2: The Room >>>

You will start in the apartment, which resembles a living unit from E1M7. Go to the front door. Shortly afterward the bathroom door will open up. You will find a hole in the wall. Climb in and you will be transported to subway world. Go left and get inside the ticket booth to open the terminal gate. Now you can get on the track. Do not travel down that track into the darkness to the right or a train going the wrong way will run you down. If you head left you will see a Skull Key. Quickly grab it and run into the nearby alcove before you get crushed. Open the Skull Door down where the Zombies rise up next to the track. Descend the stairs past the Skull Door, go under the tracks, and up the elevator.

Straight ahead through the door you will see a Shotgun. Grab it and kill the Acolyte. Go left after the stairs and clear the upper walkway, ignoring the lower subway area. Go to the ticket booth at end to open the sliding gate around the corner. The gate that moves will release a Hell Hound. Past the Hell Hound is a supply closet with a hole leading back to the apartment.

This time you will have to attack 3 shadow-like ghosts in the apartment to open up the bathroom. There is one on the couch, one in the kitchen, and one in the bedroom closet. Once the ghosts are gone, go into the bathroom and return through the (now much larger) hole back to subway world. Walk in the rain over to the stairs. Go up and grab the Dagger Key, which will open the gate ahead. Go to the far side of the big terminal (across the subway tracks) and go past the gateway to an area lit in red. Go through the Dagger Door straight ahead and turn left. The ghost nearby is going to transform into some Gill Beasts. Touch the wooden box under the flickering light and turn around. You will see a portal with green rings open up. Go through the green portal and you will arrive in the final, twisted version of the apartment, which you can finally leave through the front door. Watch out for the Zombies just outside the door to the left, then head right towards the door on the floating platform. Enter into the white light to end the mission.    




<<< E3M3: Shadehaven >>>

Cross the wooden bridges to Shadehaven's entrance. Hit the switches on each side of the entrance to unlock the front doors. Go inside. We will call this spot (where your back is to the entrance doors and you are facing the inverted cross) "Shadestart." Head to a flashing red elevator on either side of the inverted cross wall and ascend to the crystal room. Approach the inverted cross from this side of the structure and it will open up, allowing you to reach the Eye Key. Jump to grab it and fall in the golden water pool. Swim straight ahead into the next area through a tunnel and hit the submerged Eye Switch. This will open the portal directly ahead. Enter the portal and grab the Skull Key. If you want you can jump in the water, grab the ammo scattered on the sandy floor, and swim back to the area with the Eye Switch & Portal so you can escape the water. Return to the crystal room and open the Skull Doors. Ride the elevator to Floor 2. 

Enter the blue hallway on the left and you will end up outdoors. Continue to the yellow stable, watching out for a Hell Hound that is extremely difficult to shoot due to the wooden fence. Go through the wooden door and pick up the Shrink Shroom at the end of the passage. Return to Shadestart. 

Go through the doorway on the right then down the blue checkered stairs. Straight ahead is a hole in the wall near the floor. When you approach this area (now that you have the Shrink Shroom) you will be able to access the section with the Fire Key. When you are in the shrunken area, go straight through the opening in the wall. Grab the Fire Key. When you do, a wall will open revealing a cavern with tiny blue lights. Take the Grow Shroom from the center and exit the area, after which you will return to normal size. Open the nearby gate with the Fire Switch, then proceed until you reach the Fire Elevator, which will return you to Floor 2 (you can also take the Skull Elevator from earlier).

Enter the hall with the neutral/white colored light. Kill the enemies and hit the Fire Panel, which will unlock the 2 elevators in the room. Afterward, return to the area with the Fire Panel. Go to the far elevator and ride it up. Walk ahead until you get to the Fire Door. Pass through and go up the stairs and into the portal at the end of the hall. Now you are in the inverted hall where you can reach the Dagger Key and a second portal to the left of it. Grab the key and enter the new portal. You will fall into a pool of water by the metal grating. Use your new key to lower the gate outside the pool and reenter the main Floor 2 area. 

Go left into the Butcher's Dining Hall. Use your key on the Dagger Door in the back and kill the Spiders just beyond inside the 4-way hall. If you go down the left hallway you can pick up some ammo. The door opposite the dining room in the 4-way hall leads to a long passage with flashing red lights. At the end of the hall is the Spider Key. When you take it Phantasms will appear so be ready, especially since the entrance door opens slowly. Return to the main area of Floor 2 and go to the center where the 4 pillars and skylight are located. Hit the 3 Spider Switches and then the skull-faced switch. The floor will rise up, giving you access to the roof. On the roof, proceed to the vessel near the rock wall to find the end of the mission.




<<< E3M4: Bogey Beach >>>

Exit the vessel and the bookstore, then grab the Shotgun and turn right - a vehicle with Cultists will be heading your way. Blast them and break into the little office building. The hallway to the left has the Skull Key. Grab the Skull Key and head outside. There is some ammo laying on the beach so get that before you leave the area. Go into the alley next to the office and hit the skull switch, which will open the large gate on the other side of the wall. Go there, and take the ramp up to the boardwalk.

To the left is the main stretch. Down the main stretch, take as many enemies down from afar as you can manage, just as you did at the beginning of The Black Tower. The Fry Shack has some ammo inside. The boardwalk-side entrance to the office is locked so you will have to break through the window to get the Tesla Cannon. The Gameland arcade has some dangerous foes in it so be sure to clear it out. Go to the open area with the light posts and the Eye Key. Grab the Eye Key. When you do, Tchernobog will float away, leaving you to fight some Hell Hounds and Acolytes. Go to the liquor store around the corner and grab the Fire Key inside. Do not run in too hastily or you will get shot up by the fanatics behind the cash registers. Go to the bait shop. The top floor is empty, but the bottom has the key room, which you will need your Eye and Fire Keys to enter completely. The back of the boat floating by the bait shop has a shutter you can lower to get a Diving Suit and a Flare Pistol. Go into the bait shop key room and take the Dagger Key, which gives you access to the hotel on the other end of the boardwalk. 

Enter the hotel and continue until you have the Spider Key. Go back where you came from and you will find that the path has changed. Grab the Moon Key at the bottom of the swirling platforms and then return to the hotel entrance. Exit the hotel and return to the boat. Press on the boat's cabin door to end the mission.



<<< E3M5: Duck & Cover >>>

Duck & Cover will be your first big challenge in this episode. There are a lot of firefights with large numbers of foes, and you will have to develop a strategy that works best for you in each situation, as your tactics will vary greatly depending upon whether or not you brought a lot of long-range weaponry into this mission from your previous efforts. Grab the Flare Pistol and wait for the door to get destroyed. Go outside where you will see the fortified shoreline. Swim to shore and kill the Hell Hounds.

Head into town for the first big battle. Enter the building with the hole in the side from an air strike. Get the Skull Key, grab the TNT from the area where Zombies emerge, and then leave the structure. Go straight ahead past the gates. Do not get near that red beeping box - it is a powerful, armed proximity mine! Lure the Zombies lurking nearby to it. Grab the Doctor's Bag in the phone area then head to the ticket booth for the museum. Get in the booth and use your Skull Key on the switch to unlock the elevator. Ride up to the museum. 

The great hall of the museum is littered with Fanatics. After you kill one of the Cultists at the front desk they will start to scurry around from their hiding places behind the pillars. When you get to the big Tchernobog statue, go up the stairway and descend the ramp created by a fallen building. As you go down, you will see some enemies to the right. One drops Guns Akimbo, which you may want for the firefight coming up. At the bottom of the building-ramp you will have another battle. Watch out for the hidden Cultists in the alleys between buildings. When the battlefield is clear open the supply room door and get the Fire Key. Go back to the T-Bog statue. Take a left into the middle gallery. Entrances on your right and left will lead to the upper and lower galleries. Descend to the lower gallery if you need a Life Seed, but it’s trapped! In the upper gallery, use your Fire Key on the big pillar to obtain the Spider Key. Return to the museum entrance elevator and go back down to the ticket booth area.

Turn right and use the Spider Key to enter the brick building. There is Hell Hound right around the corner so toss some explosives ahead of you before entering. Climb up the wreckage and jump atop the slanted ledge of the adjacent building. Near the slanted ledge you will see a window you can jump through. Do so, then take the elevator hidden behind the wall down to the bomb shelter. Get the Dagger Key from the back room and escape the bomb shelter before it goes up in smoke. Take the Dagger Elevator to the top floor. Tchernobog is going to spawn some pests if you get close to be sure to throw an explosive his way first. Take the Moon Key and make your way outside the building down to the area near the phone where Zombies are now running around. Use the Moon Key on the radio next to the wall to call in an air strike. The explosion will destroy the wall by the phone, allowing you to reach the minefield. If you get close to one of the gray boxes you will take major (if not lethal) damage, so shoot or bomb them ahead of time. You will see a hole in the rock wall across the minefield that you will need to reach. Enter it and you will be on your way to the next mission.   




<<< E3M6: Inferno >>>

Run out of the cave and take the long elevator ride down. Jump in the lake and swim under the waterfall. You will reach a new area with 2 pools (they connect underwater). You may want to hop out from the far pool since you will emerge from the water behind some foes rather than in their sights. Hit the switch at the large gate where the Hell Hounds are trapped. If you are low on ammo simply lure them into the water. There’s a lift past the gate has two switches: One to lower the spikes around the lift and the other to raise/lower the elevator. You’ll need the Eye Key to lower the spikes, so grab the Skull Key for now and go into the other room.

Go straight ahead to the Skull Gate. Tchernobog, who stands in your path, will spawn some gargoyles. Past the gate there are 2 paths. Either way will lead you where you need to go, which is a long walkway with some Fanatics at one end. There is a small pool along this walkway. Jump in and grab the Eye Key. This will summon some Zombies outside the Skull Gate. Go back to the Eye switch that will lower the spikes surrounding the elevator and ride down.

There are many Cultists and Acolytes to dispose of on the walkway ahead, but most importantly is the Mother Spider. One well placed explosive attack will send her flying into the lava, killing her instantly and saving you a lot of ammunition. I suggest a normal dynamite toss directly in front of her (it may take a few tries to get her airborne). The path ends in a temple structure with several openings and the gateway to underworld (in the center of that giant mouth). We will call this structure “Fire Hub”. On the left side of Fire Hub you will come to a window. From there you should be able to jump to a broken-up brick walkway. Enter the room at the end of the path and hit the twitch by the lava to activate the platforms. The platforms will start to move around. The lava will kill you instantly so time your jumps well to reach the room across the way. Grab the Dagger Key in the room beyond the platforms then return to Fire Hub. Go to the right side of Fire Hub and open the Dagger Gate. Cross the invisible bridge and obtain the Fire Key. Return to Fire Hub and use the Fire Key to open the central gateway down to the Underworld section inside the mouth. Jump in.

You will see 2 blue representations of creatures called "specters”. You will need to lead a creature of that type to the space. There are 2 ways to go down here: One side is used to summon Zombies and the other Gill Beasts. Touch the statues on each path to summon the corresponding creature. You will see the summoned creature as you make your way back to the main area with the specters. Lure the creature over the correct specter space and the plate will lower. Repeat this process for both creatures. Once you have completed the task for both sides the mouth wall will open, releasing some Zealots and Cerberus. Inside the mouth there is an elevator down to the temple of flesh. If you choose to kill Cerberus to get a Life Seed, get the Tesla Cannons that the Zealots drop to make it fast. When he is dead, go down the elevator and go through the wind tunnel. You will be spit out into a vat of goo.

When you emerge from the goo, get onto the shore and step into the space with the flickering light. The bone pillars will split, allowing you to go left or right. To the left is a Diving Suit, Basic Armor, and Napalm ammo. To the right is a split section containing 2 switches. The first switch is in a strange room with a transforming pit. Do not fall in! The second switch is under the 3 blood pools. Jump in one, then head through the right-side tunnel. Emerge from the blood and head forward through the self-dividing passage to reach the second of the two switches. Return to the flickering light, using the blood tunnel on the right as you journey back. The exit from the temple will now be available. Step onto the tongue and the mouth will open, revealing an open area with a boat as well as a few Cultists and Fanatics. When you get out to the boat, go into the water to grab the Moon Key. When you have the Moon Key, turn the steering wheel on the boat to end the mission.   




<<< E3M7: Last Rites >>>

Grab the Tommy Gun and beware the lightning that will strike a nearby tree. Ahead, the path splits 2 ways. Straight ahead you should be able to see a Napalm Launcher, but it is better to head left for now. Steps will lead to an open area with a small water pool which contains a Life Essence should you require one.

By the time you reach the pool of water there will be Cultists coming from the right and the left. Before the ones from the right can reach you, fire at the TNT Barrels placed by the wall — the resulting explosion should kill several (if not all) of them if they’re close. Walk to the area where the Cultists from the right appeared, out near a walkway where you get a view of the clouds far below. Kill the Acolytes and grab the Napalm Launcher. Head back where you came from and go past the water pool to the top of the stairs. Get the Skull Key by the Fanatics. Return to the gate in front of the water pool. Open it. When you do, Tchernobog will laugh and explode, spawning Zombies. Behind him is the Hall Gateway. Kill the Zombies the head left around the corner. There are many enemies down this corridor, so be careful. Acolytes are positioned on high ground here, making them more dangerous than usual. You may need to duck down below the fallen pillar for cover. When the area is clear go up to the little building with the bright red floor. Go into the cave area, following the red floor until you come to a Wooden Chest. When you pick it up, the Hall Gate will open.

Beyond the gate is the Hall Path, with the Hall Foyer seated at the top of the stairs. When you walk down the path, Priest#1 (red-colored Cultist) will appear. When they lose all their health they will transform into Beasts. Use the Guns Akimbo item combined with Shotgun Blasts (alt fire) to push the Beast away from you, then use Tesla Cannon shots while it’s far away. You can also knock the Beast off the side of the cliff for an instant kill. When the Beast dies the entrance to the Hall Foyer will open, releasing a slew of baddies. Wipe them out and carefully enter the building, as there are probably a few that did not make it outside. Inside the foyer there are 6 stone slabs with skulls on them. Approach the foyer throne. Hit the false end-switch and some Butchers will be released along with a Mother Spider. Take out the Butchers first with explosives and then take on the Mother Spider. When she dies you will be able to progress past the Foyer to the Hall of Epiphany. After a confrontation with Tchernobog you will need to enter the Hall of Epiphany and go to the throne room on the far end to get the Eye Key. Priest#2 is in this room but will die from the explosions if you run in, so do NOT try to hurt the Priest from afar — after transforming into a Beast, the explosions will not be fatal. Take the Eye Key and return to the boat at the beginning of the mission. Priest#3 and a few other obstacles will be in your way. 

If you get in the boat and face where the lightning struck at the beginning of the mission, the Eye Door will be on your right. When you open the Eye Door, Priest#4 will come after you. Past the Priest you will see a platform with a ladder next to it. Jump up there to get the Moon Key then return to the throne room in the Hall of Epiphany (where the explosions killed Priest#2). Use the key to lower the pillar in the center of the room, which will open the passage to the final mission.




<<< E3M8: Dead End (Final Boss Level) >>>>>>

When you get close to the floating island, hop off and let the battle begin! The stone pillars can be lowered by pressing on the switches at the back of the island. There are items below the green lights in 3 different places, but if you take any of them Zombies will appear below. You can also lower or raise the walls on the structure housing the green lights, which you may want to use to keep out of Tchernobog’s sight when he gets close. When Tchernobog is beaten, step into the portal.

Now in the Void-version of the Hall of Epiphany, fight your way to the throne room and defeat Tchernobog once again. When he is defeated, proceed past the throne into the tunnel of lights. You’ll be taken to the end of the mission. 




<<< E3M9: Nightmare (Secret Level) >>>

When you start the mission, you will notice that it resembles E1M1. This impression will not last. Grab the ammo in the downstairs closet. There is a Gill Beast right outside the front door, so have your Shotgun ready. Behind the house, there are 3 Cultists guarding a Black Chest. Collect it and return to the front of the house, where you will notice that the environment has opened up. You will see some slanted platforms leading to a doorway you will want to cross through. The Fire Armor sitting on the platform far away is deceptively difficult to reach without falling to your death, so only go for it if you are a jumping expert! Through the door there are 2 Zombies. This is "Firebelly room”, followed on the left by the “Jigsaw room”. Make sure you go into the Rat holding cell inside the Jigsaw room to take the Doctor's Bag. There are Hell Hounds just one the other side of this wall, so do not try to jump through the opening (although you can throw some explosives). Proceed to the “Furnace room” with the blood-filled boiler/furnace. Wipe out the enemies - you will be returning here. Head outside and go through the window to the apartment bedroom. The closet has some items but grabbing them will summon a Phantasm near the bathroom. Go in the bathroom and head through the hole in the wall beside the bathtub. Note the translucent Gill Beast specter. Grab the Skull Key ahead and return to the Firebelly room.

Open the Skull Door and jump over the white flames to summon some Gill Beasts outside the room. Lead one through the Jigsaw room, through the gallery, and back to the translucent specter to open the wooden gate next to it. Carefully hop from one platform to the next until you make you way onto the floating vessel. There is a Life Essence sitting alone on a platform off to the side, but it is much easier to reach that platform than to escape it without falling to your doom. Enter the vessel's rear entryway. When you go out the front entrance of the vessel you will be fired on by several Fanatics. Beyond them lies a twisted chunk of E2M5 aka “Paradise room." To the left you will see find some Flares next to the Eye Door. Head into the hall where the Gill Beasts were gathered, go up the stairs, and turn right. You will see a large, dark room. Once you step down into the room turn right for the Voodoo Doll, then advance toward the floating stack of ghosts. When you get close they will disappear and release 2 Stone Gargoyles and some Acolytes behind you. When the Stone Gargoyles are dead, a door at the far end of the room (near where the ghosts were) will open, revealing the Eye Key. Grab it and head back to the Eye Door inside the Paradise room. 

Follow the invisible walkway and you will end up back in the area where you just defeated the Stone Gargoyles, only now a new area directly across from you will be open. There is a small troop of varied Cultists who will begin their assault, so ready your long-range weapon of choice. You will find that this new area is like the rear castle entrance from E2M4. When you approach the floating demon in the distance it will transform into many Gargoyles and Zealots. Inside the castle you will see a white ghost of Caleb. When you get close it will transform into a swarm of Tiny Calebs, so you may want to chuck a dynamite bundle at it. Go left into the cave. Move forward until you reach a giant face in the darkness which will carry you to the next mission. 




<<< E3M10: Morning Gory (Transition Level, Returns you to E3M5) >>>

You reawaken in the Low Tide Liquors of Bogey Beach. Grab the ammo in the store and exit. If you exit out via the hole in the wall you can get to a ledge with some Shotgun Shell Boxes. There is a trash can sitting by the side of the arcade. Break up the waste nearby and crawl through the tiny passage to claim some Proximity Mines. Down the boardwalk there is a battalion of Hell Hounds and Cerberus, who will drop a key upon death allowing you to exit the level at the front door to the docked boat. If you need more firepower, grab the Guns Akimbo out of the back of the boat. If you get desperate you can jump into the (now shallow) ocean area to escape a sticky situation.  




<<< E3M11: Demon Isle >>>

Swim to shore. Between the two big rock formations on the beach there is a path into a cave-like area with a sandy floor. Watch out for the Gill Beasts and grab the Shotgun ammo. This room will be called “CaveHub”. Break the stone face on the right, head up the stairs, and ride the vessel to the far platform. Press on the far platform’s column then either return on the vessel or wait for the rock formations to rise up and make a path. Return to CaveHub.

Break the stone face to left this time. Go up the elevator, across the bridges, press the stone face to unlock the elevator, and bring the elevator up. Go outdoors and collect some ammo, then take the elevator down. Kill the Hell Hound and taken another elevator down to the bottom. You’ll see some stepping stones. Go up the stones, grab the Skull Key, and return to CaveHub.

Two Skull Switches should know be available. Press both and then press on the gray column in front of the big door. Take the large vessel down to the next area. Go through the double-doors and into the room with a water-filled hole in the center. We’ll call this “Pool Room”. Hop in the water and located the Eye Key. Return to Pool Room. Go left to the sandy area. Hit all 3 Eye Switches that are grouped together, then press the stone-faced switch beside that group. Return to Pool Room. Go right, across the bridge, and up the elevator. Move the lever at the top. Ride back down and enter the red hallway on the right (behind the waterfall). Get the Dagger Key at the end of the hallway then return to Pool Room. Jump in the water and swim past where you picked up the Eye Key. Open the Dagger Gate and proceed through the pipe. You’ll be spat out into a large room with a few enemies guarding the mission exit door just outside the water.




<<< E3M12: The Dregs (Transition Level, Returns you to E3M7) >>>

Move forward and go out through one of the floor vents on the left or right. Go up the ramp. On the right you’ll see that you can walk on the exposed pipe and enter where the gate is broken on the left side of the building. Through the gate there is some water and another large gate made of wood. There is a switch in the room that will raise the wooden gate bit. Proceed past the small boat and up to the face-like stone structure. It will open when you get close. Beyond that and across the muck there’s a Moon Key. Return to the long boat and use the Moon Key on the steering wheel to end the mission.

********** EPISODE 1: IN COLD BLOOD **********




<<< E1M1: Home Sweet Home >>>

Go around the house’s interior collecting all the ammo, including behind the house to get more explosives. When you approach the front gate, a cart with monsters in tow will arrive. Follow the direction from which the cart arrived and cross the bridge. SECRET#1: Before crossing, grab the Basic Armor under the bridge. You will come to another longer bridge. If you want some more Shotgun ammo early you can run across and grab it (you will be returning there once you have the Spider Key). To continue, ignore the long bridge and go through the dark cave. Continue into the lit areas of the cave until you reach an elevator. REQUIRED FOR SUPER-SECRET: If you destroy the wall in the lit cave area before reaching the elevator, you can find a hidden Moon Key out on the ledge. Once at the bottom of the elevator, continue forward until you get the Spider Key. Be careful of the Zombies hiding in the darkened areas down there. Once you have the Key you will want to backtrack completely out of the cave areas to the original long bridge. Head across the long bridge and grab the Shotgun ammo if you did not earlier. Open the door. 

Ahead you will fall through the false floor and land in the blood river. What a nasty trick! There are many Gill Beasts here, but if you have skill to take them out without getting seriously wounded, you will find that several of them will drop health and are worth killing. If you are not good against Gill Beasts get out of the water quickly and jump across the pond using the platforms as much as you can. SUPER-SECRET: Under the water use your Moon Key to get into the Moon door for some items and then pass through the teleporter to obtain Jump Boots. SECRET#2: On the opposite side of the underwater area to the right lies a small cave with Armor (secret 2). Go through the portal next and kill some Cultists after going to the other side. Make sure to grab the Tesla Cannons the Zealots drop since you will need it for the next battle. Enter the area with your destroyed home and defeat the monsters that appear, using the Tesla Cannon on the Stone Gargoyle. SECRET#3: If you need more Flares, there are some hidden alongside the flaming cart that greeted you at the beginning of the mission. Grab the Key that appears at the top of the house when the Stone Gargoyle dies. Go back where you came from to find that some Zombies have appeared out of the 2nd portal (not the one leading to the blood river). Enter this portal and use your Key to open the door. Hop into the blood pool to get the Eye Key. SECRET#4: If you push one of the mounted stone faces in this hallway a passage will open up revealing some ammo. Open the gate with your Key and head outside to the final area.




<<< E1M2: Lost Highway >>>

Head out of the forest and cross the road (avoiding the truck to the left) into the woods. There are some hidden Gill Beasts in here so watch out. On the other side of the woods is a tunnel. If you run far enough into the tunnel a truck will come barreling through, killing everything in its path — you will need to run back into the woods or stay flat up against the rocky wall to avoid it. Open the gate and make your way across the swampy area to the next road. SECRET#1: If you are low on ammo you will find some more hidden in the swamp area - if you are facing the road from the swamp it will be to the left. On this road a deadly car will continuously drive back and forth, so keep your wits about you. This car will kill friend and foe alike so feel free to lure enemies into its path. Hit the switch in the guard tower to rotate the concrete bridge. SECRET#2: If you run along the top of the bridge's right wall you will be able to reach a secret area with Reflective Shots on the opposite side, which will come in handy in the next room. The room across the bridge is crawling with Cultists who will make short work of you if you dash in. Try luring them outside or toss in a bit of dynamite. There is a barred gate here that is closed. If you have the means, you may want to kill the Hell Hound behind the bars before you raise them. To raise the bars, head up the spiral stairs and hit the switch. Jump into the cart and hit the switch to send it flying down the tunnel. Ignore the explosions - they will not hurt you if you remain in place inside the cart while it is moving. SECRET#3: The cleared tunnel contains a small alcove with a Napalm Launcher. Head up the waterfall and move through the woods until you see a Fanatic. SECRET#4: If you go underwater before heading up the waterfall you will find a secret underwater passage with some Flare supplies. Continue through the woods to the next road. 

The Cultists have set up a roadblock with boxes and a truck. Alternate fire for the Flare gun works especially well here. Past the little red-lit tunnel a gate will open releasing Hell Hounds. You may want to lay some more Proximity Mines as you will waste a lot of precious gun ammo defeating them. SECRET#5: Instead of going down the ramp you can jump onto the nearby building rooftops. The roof of the brick building with 2 smoke stacks has a Doctor’s Bag. After defeating the enemies near the destroyed ramp, head into the small control room at ground level lit up with orange lights, looking out for hidden Cultists along the way. SECRET#6: If you go past the location of the last Cultist before entering the control room, you will see a ledge the leads around the building to the left. Go out on the ledge to find a stockpile of Proximity and Remote Mines. One of the barrels near the control room entrance will explode and release several Choking Hands if you get close, but you can use TNT to destroy them first. After the barrels head to the right of the split and mow down the Fanatics. Get the Key down the hallway then return to hit the switch, revealing the Dagger Key. Grab the Dagger Key and run out of the control room immediately before the outer door closes. Outside, new forces have arrived, and you will need to get through them to reach the guard tower near the road block. Hit the switch at the top of the tower to raise the final bridge. There’s a switch in the toll booth you will need to toggle before the final doorway opens. Head across the bridge to the next mission.



<<< E1M3: Firebelly >>>

Move through the tunnel and go outside. Go down the walkway alongside the water until you reach the next tunnel. SECRET#1: Before going in, look right and you will see some concrete slants jutting out from the wall. Use them as stepping stones to reach some hidden items in the rock wall. Move forward until the Hell Hound sees you, then drop some Proximity Mines to weaken it before you start firing shells or bullets. Continue with a long-range weapon in hand to fight the enemies on the far side of the bridge. Watch out for the Cultist to the right hiding behind the guard tower. SECRET#2: If you head up into the tower you can get your hands on a Limited Invisibility. Head up the dark passage to the house. The right side of the house has some ammo in a box you will want to grab. On the far side of the house is a stone pillar that requires the Fire Key. Ignore it for now, and head to the roof for the Skull Key. Get the Key and head inside the house. A Cultist is hiding in there so be careful. Open the basement door, go down the steps, and hop in the water. SECRET#3: While in the water, be sure to press on the wall with the bloody hand stains. A wall will open behind you revealing a Life Leech & ammo. Once you emerge from the water you will find that you have been transported to another dimension. 

The lava will kill you instantly so watch where you jump. SECRET#4: Behind the doorway structure there is small ledge you can jump up to which has a Fire Armor and some health. Before you get to the Fire Key there is a small rock tunnel you must go through. SECRET#5: Go through it and look left as soon as you move to the next platform — you should be able to see a partially hidden area with a tiny stepping stone leading to it. Make your way to the hidden area and grab the Moon Key, which you will need to get to the secret level. Get the Asbestos Armor, too, so you can run through the lava unharmed. As you move along you will see the Fire Key on your right atop the elevated platform. Jump up to grab it, then immediately continue ahead or duck down in the nearby boat to avoid the fireballs. Keep going to the end and you will be able to see the portal back to the original house behind a barrier. There is a Hell Hound hiding around the corner. The Return Portal’s barrier requires the Dagger key. Head into the Lava Temple behind the barrier. The doors to the left lead back outside where a blue light orbits a glowing orb. Follow the path of the orbiting light, which is following an invisible path that you can walk across (use 2D map mode here to make it easier). Take the Spider key and go back to the Lava Temple lobby. Go through the other set of doors and blow up the nearby wall. Enter through the hole and continue along the path until you eventually reach the Dagger Key. After adding it to your collection go back to the Dagger Key barrier and move though the Return Portal behind it, which will take you back to the icy house. 

Go to the stone pillar behind the house and use your Fire Key. Cross the platforms that rise and continue into the gated arena building. Go through the door on the right. Some Cultists are waiting for you in the middle of the next hallway, so come around the corner with your gun blazing or throw some explosives ahead of you. SECRET#5: There is a weapon training area with two Zombies. Jump onto the walls enclosing the area to reveal not only a Life Seed, but also Key 7 sitting out in the middle of the water. You will need this to get to the secret level, so quickly swim across the water avoiding the Gill Beasts. Grab Key 7 and go back over the weapon training wall. Continue down the hall and into the arena. If you have a Life Leech you may want to use its alternate fire here to help thin the crowd. Save your Shotgun ammo for the Spiders, as they will not take much damage from TNT. This is a great place to use spare Proximity Mines if you normally cannot find a use for them. When you have killed enough the spectators will explode and you will be able to head to The Abyss. Across from the exit there is a gate you can open with the Moon Key. Behind it, a Key 7 door leads to the secret level (E1M9).




<<< E1M4: The Abyss >>>

Jump into the water-filled opening and swim ahead. When you pop out of the water in the next area you will see the entrance to the Abyss. SECRET#1: If you stay underwater and look around you will find a little ice tunnel that leads to a Basic Armor. Tchernobog is ahead, and will give you some important information. SECRET#2: In the room where you see Tchernobog, turn around and face the doorway you came through. You’ll see a switch near the door frame that will reveal a Life Seed. Go through the door and go down the hole to floor 1. 

Head through the door to the stairwell. SECRET#3:There is a ledge to the right at the top of the stairs where some blood is flowing down. Jump to the ledge and find the hidden passage with a Napalm Launcher. Go down the stairs until you reach a structure with windows. This is the church. Go around to the side of the building and shoot the Cultists through the windows. There is a Fanatic in there, too, so you may want to toss in some explosives. Once inside, go into the first door on the right which leads to the supply room. Grab all the items inside, including the first of 3 Tomes that will reveal the Eye Key. The next door leads to the nave and chancel of the church. SECRET#4: Across from this door is a stone face in the wall. Shoot it to reveal a secret area with a Tesla Cannon. The church nave is full of enemies. You may want to alert them to your presence with some gunfire, then exit back outside to use the door as a bottleneck. Grab the 2nd Tome sitting on the pulpit to the right of the cross. SECRET#5: Behind the choir seating on the right side of this area is a window. Shoot it out and go onto the outside ledge where a Feather Fall item is placed. If you get this, you can quickly exit the church at this point and jump into the main chasm to reach floor 2 before the effect wears off. There is a passageway near the pipe organ leading to an area with a Life Essence. Grabbing it will summon Zombies so only do so if you need health more than ammo. This also leads to the the back entrance of the church's 2nd area. Go through here (watch out for the painting that a Choking Hand jumps through) and kill the Choking Hands that run towards you. Straight ahead is the doorway from the front entrance. On the sides of the hallway are 2 rooms. One has a bookcase and some Cultists. SECRET#6: Press on the bookcase near the back wall to reveal a secret bookshelf with a Voodoo Doll. The other room has a Fanatic and the final Tome. Grab the Tome and the stained glass window behind the cross will shatter. The area behind the broken window has the Eye Key. Grab the Key and head out of the church completely to get back to the giant staircase. Head to the bottom of the stairs and ride the elevator down. Hop through the hole and you will be on the floor 2. 

SECRET#7: Shoot one of the 2 stone wall panels in this room to reveal a small passage leading to Body Armor. Go out the main door and kill the Cultist who is carrying a Diving Suit. Dive into the bloody river and fight the 2 Gill Beasts. Swim in the direction they came from until you reach a new area. Above the surface you will see Tchernobog waiting. Get near him and he will transform into a cluster of Spiders. Hop back into the river where the Spiders will follow you to their doom. Keep swimming until you see a small opening with bubbles around it. Get out of the river here and continue until you get the Key. SECRET#8: There is a crack in the rocky wall before you reach the room with the keep. Blow up the wall and go through the revealed passage to find some hidden ammo. Return to where Tchernobog transformed. Go through the door and head down to floor 3. Get an explosive weapon ready. As soon as you open the door Zombies will flood the room, and there is no space to jump over them. Kill enough and a rock wall will open. Three colored lights will lead to 3 passageways. Follow the blue light to the entrance on the right to proceed to the next mission.




<<< E1M5: Jigsaw >>>

SECRET#1: Go down the steps and look left. Press the handprint on the wall to reveal a hidden Flare Pistol. SECRET#2: Head across the room and jump over to the area between the safe and the pillar. The side of the safe has a hidden switch that will open a wall near the door where you entered. Go into the passage and grab the Basic Armor. Go to the door where Tchernobog exited and open it with a Shotgun in hand. A Phantasm will burst out, and you will want to kill it as it will be a big nuisance. Continue through the door and go right to another door. Head down the hallway and hit the switch at the end, which will fill up the toilet on the other side of the wall. Go to the toilet and grab the Skull Key. You will hear a shattering noise, which is a compartment on the white wall of the main area breaking open revealing several Choking Hands. Kill the Choking Hands and hit the switch near the bathtub. The bathtub will fill with blood, which will drain the vat of blood located on the opposite side of the wall. Go to the vat and hop down. Crawl through the passage and hit the switch. The white wall where the Choking Hands appeared will now start moving backward, opening up a new area. Go to the new area and grab the Key behind the white wall. Head to the safe, open it, grab the final Key for the area, and exit through the big metal door. Go outside and head around to the back of the building. SECRET#3: If you walk along the top of the stone perimeter wall you’ll come across a Reflective Shots item. You will come to a set of stairs leading to a control room. SECRET#4: To the left of the stairs there is a wall with a bloody handprint. Press the handprint and a wall on the side of the building will open revealing some ammo. Use an explosive to clear the control room of a hiding Fanatic and hit the switch inside. Look out the window and you will see a door opening. There are some TNT barrels down there that will kill most of the enemies, so you may want to try firing some explosives down there. Head through the new opening until you reach the bomb room. You will need to hit all 4 switches and grab the Fire Key to escape before time runs out. When time dissipates the bomb will explode, killing anything in the room (the explosions will go no further than the room). If you damage the bomb by accident it will go off immediately so aim carefully when fighting. 

Move forward and kill the Gill Beast to your right. When you approach the bridge Tchernobog will destroy it with explosions, so do not try to run across. Go down the passage whence the Gill Beast came until you come to the open waterfall area. SECRET#5: If you jump into the water, you will see a passage that leads to the area below the bridge that was destroyed. Go here and look left to find a hidden alcove with some supplies. Continue up the earthen stairway until you reach the area with some spiderwebs. There is a small hole on the right with some ammo inside. You may move through the passage and jump over to where Tchernobog was standing earlier. SECRET#6: Before jumping to Tchernobog's spot, look left and you will see that you can jump to the top of the waterfall. Do this, then go through the falling water into a secret room. Attack the body on the wall and it will leave behind a Life Seed. If the bridge has not blown up yet it will when you get close, so watch out. Move past the eye door to the big spiderweb. Near the big spiderweb there is a hole containing several Spiders and a Guns Akimbo with Shotgun ammo. You can grab this at any time since this area of the mission is always available from this point, but you may want to do it now. Head around the curve and jump into the Spider nest. When you grab the Spider Key at the end, Spiders will appear to defend the nest, including a Mother Spider who will make more. If you still have Guns Akimbo, try using alternate fire Shotgun blasts to knock the Mother Spider off a ledge to her doom. You do not have to kill any of them, so if you are low on ammo and high on health try running through them. Return to the Eye Door and kill the 2 Cultists standing right behind it. Enter the door straight ahead and grab the Flares located outside. If you go right instead you’ll find a caved-in section with a single Zombie that drops a Life Essence. The final door leads to the next key. The dangling body will burst with Spiders if you get close, so blow it up beforehand. Grab the Dagger Key at the end of the passage and leave the Eye Door area. SECRET#7: Go behind the waterfall (see SECRET#6) and open the Dagger Door to obtain a Doctor’s Bag and Key 7. Go to the left of the wall where the Spider nest is located. You need to raise the platform so you can cross. If you ride the platform back down you will see a walkway leading to the secret level (E1M11). You’ll need Key 7 to reach it. If you want to go back just use a switch a by the moving platform to get yourself back to the Dagger Door. Once through the Dagger Door you can head right to continue to the next mission. If you want Super Armor (and a challenge), head to the door straight ahead. Grab the armor at the end of the passage. When you come back around the corner you will find the hallway flooded with Zombies. Go through the Exit door to go to the next mission.




<<< E1M6: What Lies Beneath >>>

As you come through the opening doors, unload some long-range ammo on the Cultists before they ride close enough to fire on you. There are Hell Hounds running around this outside area, too. Run up to the facility and fight your way into the guard tower where you will find a bunch of Tommy Gun ammo and a Skull Key to access the main building. You can also skip this key and enter the main building on the left side by shooting out the windows to the Eye Key room. SECRET#1: If you run around the right side of the main building you will find a Limited Invisibility. SECRET#2: There is also a small hut by the main building you can enter to find Basic Armor and Spray Cans. Inside the main building you’ll need to grab the Eye Key through the only unlocked door. SECRET#3: Press on the bookshelf in the Eye Key room to get ahold of some Shotgun ammo. Outside the door, Zombies have filled the hallway. Access the medical lab at the end of the hall with your Eye Key. Grab the Dagger Key inside (watch out for the Choking Hand), the Tesla Cannon, and the Doctor's Bag from the metal medical supply closet. SECRET#4: Use explosives the wall with the medical charts and one will reveal a hidden passage to Body Armor and Spray Cans. Exit the lab and kill more Zombies. Go through the Dagger Door and head underground to the saucer. 

Step into the light and you will appear inside the ship. Open the door (many Choking Hands are inside) and get the Spider Key. Watch out for the Gill Beast that appears in the saucer and head back out. Return to the main hallway in the building and go through the last remaining door. You will head underground again. There is some ammo to the left by the barrels and a long passage to the right. Go past the Spiders and clear out the passage and the boiler room. SECRET#5: Hop into the boiler flames to grab a Life Seed. Grab the Fire Key and hit the switch on the boiler. The boiler will overheat and explode very soon so run past the rising Zombies and get back to the upper floor via the stairs. When the explosions have stopped, run through the opening the explosions created in the rock wall and continue through the dark. Defeat all the creatures in the flashing red area (and there are quite a few - save ammo for the Mother Spider), and be sure to stand away from the pillar of flesh when you kill the Mother Spider since explosions will go off. Drop into the hole behind the flesh pillar and fall into the water. Climb out onto the concrete and go up the stairs to the end of the mission.




<<< E1M7: Urban Decay >>>

Use the barrel to jump up on the wall and walk along the ledge to the area with the truck. Kill the Cultist and the truck will move forward allowing you to get the Dagger Key on the ground behind it. Go back to where you started. Ignore the stairs and head into the apartment building. Tchernobog will transform into a large brood of Rats if you get close, so toss some TNT his way. Go into the first apartment with blue carpeting and watch out for the Zombie behind the door. Get the health in the kitchen if you need it (you will be returning to this apartment) as well as ammo and armor from the bedroom closet. Kill the Zombie hiding in the bathroom and a wall will open up in the bedroom, letting you pass into the blue apartment. There are a slew of Zombies beyond the bedroom door so be ready. Kill the Butcher in the kitchen for the Skull Key and head back out of the apartment building (watch out for the Phantasm that appears in the red apartment after killing the Butcher). Go up the stairs in the starting area and kill the Fanatic in the elevator booth. Hit the switch and bring the elevator down, which will be carrying 2 Cultists. Ride up the elevator and clear out the office. Take your time and clear out the office slowly - there are Cultists hidden in some of the cubicles. SECRET#1: Break through the window near the manager's door to get a Super Armor out on the ledge. Get the Fire Key from a Butcher in the women's bathroom. The other bathroom has a Flare gun. Enter the manager's office and immediately blast the Zealot with gunfire before he can get a shot off. Break the large window in his office and jump to the closest rooftop straight ahead. This is a very tricky jump, and any misstep will send you plummeting to your death. Once outside, navigate over to the window of another apartment building and break in. A Gargoyle will break into the bedroom so you may want your Tesla Cannon handy. Jump out the window of the bathroom (where a Zombie is hiding) onto a rooftop. Look at the blinking green finance sign and turn left - you will see an office you will be visiting later with some baddies in it. You can try to take them out early by breaking the window furthest to the left and tossing some explosives up there. Look at the blinking green finance sign and turn right - you will see the finance building and an entrance. 

Jump down to the financial building and ride the elevator to the ground floor. Head over to the exit sign and go left. There is some ammo in the first bathroom. SECRET#2:If you press on the bloody handprint inside the bathroom stall, a secret chamber will open up containing some Basic Armor and Tesla ammo. The dark bathroom has a Doctor’s Bag if you need it, but 2 Phantasms will appear as soon as you pick it up. Activate the elevator at the end of the hall, which is full of Zombies. A Spray Can or Proximity Mines may be useful here. Ride the elevator up and kill the Cultists if you did not earlier. SECRET#3: Break the first window on the left as you enter this top floor and jump outside near the fan where you will find a Life Seed. Get the Key in the last cubicle. A green Cultist is now blocking the elevator. If you shoot or get near him he will blow up the entire floor and the next rooftop, so only do it if you are fast. Take the same route as before back down to the ground floor of the finance building. Zombies will break through the exit doors when you approach. Head out into the parking lot and get ready for a big fight. SECRET#4: If you come outside and go left along the building, you will come to some metal canisters and a hidden Napalm Launcher. Go to the top of the tower on the border wall and grab the Eye Key. Several Zealots will appear when the window breaks on the previous building. Get back inside the building and go left. Bring the elevator down (it has a Butcher and a Hell Hound) and ride up to the end of the mission. SECRET#5: Before hitting the end-level switch, hop out the nearby window and head down to the area with large wooden crates near a wall. This lower area contains Super Armor and a Life Essence.




<<< E1M8: Vertigo >>>

Kill the Cultist at the top of the elevator. Zombies will start breaking out of their statues, but if you have explosives you can kill them before they break out. After a certain amount of time has passed the doors to the next area will open. SECRET#1: You can also walk along the outside ledge of the building to reach the Hound Room early and grab Super Armor. SECRET#2: If you face the starting elevator, the snake panel to right can open up to reveal a Life Leech. When all the Hounds have perished in this starting section a doorway will appear. SECRET#3: Press the bloody handprint on the nearby stairway wall to open the way to a Life Seed behind the fireplace. Head to the rooftops. There are a bunch of enemies up here, but you will have to kill the Stone Gargoyle to end the episode. There are some helpful guns around the bigger buildings if you run low on ammo. Save up your Tesla shots for the Stone Gargoyle. 




<<< E1M9: Spooky World (Secret Level) >>>

Start by running up the stairs into the ticket line area. Both ticket booths have some ammo so be sure to go into those. Fight your way to Spooky World's crossroads with the spinning hologram. The snack stands both have good items, so be sure to grab them all. Straight ahead is the entrance to the final section, but you will need all 4 of the Keys placed around the park first. The order in which you obtain them is irrelevant. Each attraction has 1 Key. SECRET#1: There’s a Limited Invisibility behind the “Everything Fried” stand. SECRET#2: Facing the Happy-Go-Pukey entrance, there’s a wooden wall directly to the left. Jump over it and follow the path to a Life Seed.

Pandemonium Shadow Show:
Head down the hallway and keep going straight until you get the ammo following the other entrance to the theater. Grab the Fire Key on the stage and mow down the enemies. Move along the wall until you find your way out or wait for the curtain to ascend. Walk down the long hallway if you don’t want to wait for the curtain which leads to the starting area.

Miskatonic Station:
The main pathway to this area is blocked with a gate. You will have to break the vent in the scream burger stand to reach this area. Once inside, walk toward the bridges but wait for the train to pass by first. You will find the Spider Key on the upper floor of the gift shop. SECRET#3: If you jump out the window with the missing bars, you will see a Super Armor sitting in the path of the train. Wait for the train to pass then grab it.

Happy-Go-PuKey:
The Eye Key is on the furthest platform. If you fall in, avoid the Gill Beasts and use the stairs near the waterfall to escape. Enemies will appear at the top of the stairs after you grab the Key.

River Ride of Terror:
Kill everyone in the line for the ride - it will make your return much easier (especially if you accidentally fall in the water). SECRET#4: Hop on top of the waterfall next to the big sign and located the Tesla supplies. Get in the river boat and hit the switch. Prepare for several enemies who will fire on the boat as it moves. Grab the Dagger Key at the end of the ride and return to the boat. Hitting the switch again will make it return. SECRET#5: If you jump out of the boat to where the Cultists were firing their guns at you, you will discover a hidden Napalm cache.

Now that you have all the Keys, head to the entrance to the final section: The House of Horrors. Kill the Fanatics and activate the 4 switches. There is a small army behind the gate that drops so ready your explosives. Run through the forest with the Gargoyles and you will come to the lines for the House of Horrors. Fight your way into the attraction (Flare gun fire works well here) and press on the door to descend. There is a Guns Akimbo on top of one of the wooden shelves you may want to get before clicking on the door. At the bottom you will have to mow down some Zombies and several Cultists in the room that follows which contains the ride carts. Head down the hallway and watch out for the Phantasm who bursts through the window. SECRET#6-A: If you jump through the broken window you will be able to find a hidden Feather Fall item. In the next area just run up the ramp. SECRET#6-B: Before Feather Fall wears off, jump off the ramp to the lower floor. You will obtain a Medicine Pouch and a Life Leech around the corner. Take the elevator by the ramp to get back on track. Keep moving along the ride's metal railway until you reach the blue ballroom. Grab the Key in the middle of the room and fight off the horde that appears. The curtains will eventually rise allowing you to move on after the Stone Gargoyle is dead. Go to the ramp leading upwards and watch out for the Hell Hound around the corner. SECRET#7: If you walk into the Cerberus display you will find some Napalm ammo behind the false flames. Continue through the rest of the ride and you will end up back at the ride's seating area with the carts. Go through the Moon Door and destroy the wall near the clock. Go through the hole, turn right, duck under the wooden panel, and open the door to complete the mission. 




<<< E1M10: Ring of Fire (Transition Level, Returns you to E1M4) >>>

Head down the blue passage and go through the door. Grab the Shotgun and continue through the second door. The hallway that follows is packed with Zombies so get your explosives ready. SECRET#1: If you jump up on the outside area's wall ledge you will be able to grab a Napalm Launcher. Keep moving along to the large outdoor space surrounded by flames. There are a lot of Hell Hounds so keep moving. Defeat all the creatures to move on to the next mission.




<<< E1M11: Shudder Island (Secret Level) >>>

Kill the guard to get the key so you can open your cell. Go into the manager area to the left and hit the switch to open the elevator up at the opposite end of the hallway. SECRET#1: You’ll see that one of the cells (next to the manager section) has a bed turned over so that you can’t see the Zealot inside. Go into the adjacent cell and shoot the Zealot through the hole in the wall. This will open the Zealot’s cell where you can pick up Tesla supplies and a Life Essence. Head to the end of the hall, hit the switch on the wall to the right to unlock the elevator, and head down. Proceed down the stairs to the bottom floor, passing by an elevator that requires 3 keys. Once outside in the rain, look left toward some barrels. Destroy them to blow up the wall. Inside, go right to the room with the Dagger Key. SECRET#2: You can move a bookshelf in this room to find some Body Armor. The other pathway leads to a rocky hole in the wall. Follow it into the flooded area and get the Spider Key. SECRET#3: There’s a bloody handprint near the rocky hole. Press on it to open a secret compartment nearby with a Box of Shotgun Shells. Return outdoors. Enter the Dagger Door by the boat. This structure has a low and high path. Take the high path to get to the Fire Key. SECRET#4: The lower path leads to a room where you can open the window shutters. Do this, then walk along the thin wooden ledge outside to the left. You’ll come across a small gray switch that will open a door along the ledge. Inside lies a Napalm Launcher and Basic Armor. Exit the structure through the glass window to reach the area on the other side of the wall. Shoot the barrels along the wall to create an opening. SECRET#5: Climb up the wrecked wall to a higher platform where some Flares are seated in the corner. Head out to the beach for Eye Key. SECRET#6: Jump from the spiked gate to the top of the beach’s perimeter wall. Wall along the wall to the part with 3 columns. The center one has a switch in the middle. Use it to open a nearby room directly in front of you with Fire Armor and Spray Cans. Return to the 3-Key Elevator. Go down, grab the Moon Key, and return to the boat outdoors. Use the boat’s steering wheel to complete the mission.




<<< E1M12: Old Sins (Transition Level, Returns you to E1M6) >>>

Ascend to the top of the rocks and enter the church on the left side through the window. Inside there are some Cultists guarding Life Essences. SECRET#1: Play the organ to open a secret area with a Napalm Launcher. SECRET#2: There is another hole in the wall behind the organ. Jump from there to the nearby rock formation outside, the proceed along the wall until you reach the Life Seed. Return to the church. Exit the church area and go down the long passage. SECRET#3: About halfway down the passage you’ll pass some big rock formations. Jump off the lowest one to reach the long rock wall on the left. Once on the wall, head right and look for a switch near the end of the wall. Hit it to open a big door nearby where Napalm supplies are hidden. Take the elevator up at the end of the long passage and go past the spiderwebs and Eye Door into an ice-filled room. Get the Eye Key past this room and then backtrack. Before you can get back to the Eye Door a gate will rise up, forcing you into a short battle. When the gate goes back down you can enter the Eye Door. Head down the left passage and grab the Dagger Key. Return to the elevated platform, cross it, and then enter the Dagger Door. Go straight ahead for Super Armor and an enemy assault or go right to exit the mission.




********** EPISODE 2: Scar Trek **********




<<< E2M1: Armada >>>

Stay still while the cart is in motion then hop onto the vessel (which I will refer to as "ships") when the cart stops. This is Ship A. Go through the door to the right and clear the area. SECRET#1: Shoot out the windows and climb onto the outside ledge for some Basic Armor. Go through the door straight across from the one you used to enter Ship A and wait for the trailing ship to arrive. When it does the gate will come down and Zombies will run out. If you are skilled you can bomb a few of them with TNT before the ship arrives. Once a few have died the main cabin will open up allowing you to get the Skull Key. Go back into Ship A and take the door on the left. Activate the cannon and return to the trailing ship. The ship that you fired on will have come close enough to enter. Grab the Eye Key from inside and go back to where you first hopped off your original cart. Walk across the chain connectors to the mini ship. Ignore the cannon and move to the rear of Ship B. You will see a switch that will lower the back wall. Press it and return to the mini ship. Rotate the cannon using your Eye Key FIRST, then fire the cannon to make a path into Ship B. You can not blow up the wall before activating the cannon. Clear the inside of Ship B. SECRET#2: There is a small switch on the wall of the cannon loading bay. Hit it to open up a compartment with Body Armor. The door to exit Ship B will open when you get near it, and there are many Zombies waiting for a chance to get inside. Use explosives here to conserve ammo or draw them inside and dodge them. Move straight across the chains to the head of the caravan. Hop in the little cart and drive over to the giant Ship C. 

Starting from where you entered, go to the first door on the left. Head down the hallway and kill the Butcher in the bathroom for the Fire Key. Return. Starting from where you entered, go to the door on the right. Clear the navigation room and grab the Spider Key. SECRET#3: If you hop into the furnace you will be able to get your hands on a Life Seed. Return. Starting from where you entered, go to the furthest door to the left. When you run down the walkway a Fanatic will come along on your right and start firing. Unload a Shotgun blast on him and move forward. SECRET#4: If you press on the bloody handprint in the walkway area it will open a panel revealing a Napalm Launcher, which could come in handy in the next room. Go through the door ahead and take out the baddies. As soon as you access the Spider Key locked panel the wall to the left will shoot up revealing several enemies. You will have to act fast to avoid the TNT being thrown. Exit through the rear door of Ship C and fire the giant cannon to end the mission.




<<< E2M2: Out to Launch >>>

Move until you can see the wrecked ship. Go right and grab the Skull Key inside the ship buried in sand. Head through the destroyed ship to the next outdoor area. SECRET#1: Before leaving the ship, you should look for a window panel that you can crawl through to obtain some Body Armor. Use the Key to unlock the cannon on the mini ship ahead. While the cannon rotates, fire it to destroy the wall blocking the path of the rocket cart. Once the wall is destroyed, activate the rocket cart to send it careening down the channel. The ensuing explosion should wipe out the wealth of enemies in the passage, as well as destroy a wall near the end. SUPER-SECRET: Before jumping through the broken section of the wall to the right, go left around the back of the building. At the end of the sand walkway a Zombie will rise out of the ground. Jump off its head while running to reach the elevated area past the end of the walkway. Inside the cave you’ll find a Life Seed, Reflective Shots, Napalm Launcher, and Jump Boots (with which you can do much of what follows in this mission out-of-order). Jump through the broken section of wall and you will come to an open area with stairs and a green, toxic pool. You can ignore the Butchers for now - you will be back to enter the garage behind them. SECRET#2: There is a Life Leech on the side of a truck among the metal waste cans. Go up the stairs and hit the switch in the Garage Access Area to open the garage door. Looking out the window, you will see a band of Zombies have been released. Since there are so many you may want to employ explosives or your Spray Can. Enter the garage. There is some ammo inside the canister carrier. Go through the door and open the gate leading to the elevator. Head up and you will find yourself in the Space Center. 

Note the colored lines on the floor as they correspond to the labels listed on the wall. Head to the first door on the left (the Bathroom). Grab the ammo and hop into the upper vent, which will lead to the Supply Room. When you exit the Supply Room there will be enemies on you immediate left, so fire away. SECRET#3: The Bathroom has a ground-level vent with Reflective Shots if you want to drop into the control room safely. Press on the wall near the toilet (with a bloody handprint) to lower the toilet and reveal the vent). Head to the control room. Clear out the enemies and grab the Eye Key. Take the space center elevator out in the hallway to the launch bay at ground level or just jump out the control room window (you will take some damage). Go past the rocket to the little building beneath the rocks. SECRET#4: To the right is a wall you can blow up revealing some Gargoyles and a Super Armor. Grab the Fire Key in the building under the mountainside and open the Fire panel to get a Tommy Gun. Press the Eye switch to unlock the rocket clamps. SECRET#5: Go to the large gate on the left of the space center and hit the switch to lower it. Run up the stairs to the Garage Access Area and open the Fire Door to get some Tesla supplies then return to the launch bay. Press the 2 switches at the base of the rocket to move the clamps in preparation for launch. Return to the Space Center control room and hit the switch to open the shuttle doors. SECRET#6: If you follow the green line on the floor at this point, it will lead you to a room that has caved in. On the wall near the entrance you should see a small switch that will reveal Limited Invisibility. Follow the red line on the floor to the shuttle. Drop down the ladder move along until you get to the elevator. Kill the Cultist riding it and hop in. It will rise back up into the shuttle on its own. Hit the switch and you will be on your way to the heavens!




<<< E2M3: Mothership >>>

Head out of the shuttle into the ship bay. Ride the elevator up and go to the control panel to open shuttle 2. Break the canister next to the controls for some shells. When shuttle 2 opens grab the Key inside and return to the upper area to open the gateway out of the ship bay. You will enter the operations hub, or "OPS”, and there are a number of ways to go from here. The following method will make sure you are always stocked up with supplies. Go to the armory, grab what you can carry, and head back to OPS. It will be crawling with monsters so ready any explosives you have available. They will pour of out of the open door so make sure you do not blow yourself up. Clear out OPS and go to the cargo bay. SECRET#1: On the way, there is a low vent behind a grate with flashing red lights. Crawl in and you will pick up Limited Invisibility. In the cargo bay you will need to jump on the boxes to reach the vent system. Hop in and go right. Keep going until you end up in the room with the swinging chains. SECRET#2: There is a detour in the vent system behind a breakable grate which leads to a group of Choking Hands that guard a Life Leech. Continue to the swinging chain room. Get the Eye Key and fight off the monsters. Return to OPS. 

Head towards the crew quarters. Kill the Gargoyles in the corridor and go to the next door. SECRET#3: If you turn around you will see a metal grate above the other door. Fire at it and a secret panel will open with some supplies. The corpse in there will burst with Choking Hands so toss some TNT its way. Continue through the door to the rotating hub, which we will call “Spin Hub”. Enter the door marked CREW. Grab the Dagger Key and wait for the foes to break out of the sleep pods (the door you came through will be locked until they all appear). You can lay Remote or Proximity Mines on the pods ahead of time to get them as soon as they appear. SECRET#4: Face the barred conveyer belt behind the welcome sign. Enter through the broken bars. Go left on the belt to find some sewage water containing a Life Seed. Return to Spin Hub. 

Enter the door marked POD. You will see the space pod on the right. This room connects to the armory so if you need to restock do it now. SECRET#5: The space pod room has a computer panel that opens to reveal a Voodoo Doll. Get in the space pod and hit the switch to send it floating around the mothership to the mini ship bay that’s connected to the Crew room. Once the pod door opens hop out before it explodes. Grab the Spider Key and head straight back to Spin Hub. At this point you will be able to open a Spider Door by the shuttle bay control panel from the beginning of the mission. You may want to do this now as time will be short after getting the Moon Key.

Enter the door marked CORE. SECRET#6: There is a metal grate near the floor to the right near the Core entrance door. Go in for some ammo and health then return to the Core section. Some Choking Hands will drop from a ceiling grate so look out. You will enter a room full of machinery. SECRET#7: If you walk behind some of the machinery on the right you will see a flashing switch. Use it to reveal a hidden Napalm cache. Head into the darkened core control room. Hit the 3 switches in order from left to right. Instructions on how to escape the self destruct sequence will be displayed. Push the 2 white pillars and grab the Moon Key. When you do, the self destruct will begin. Immediately run to Spin Hub, then to the POD room, then through the Armory room, then to OPS, then to the shuttle bay control panel. The button for shuttle 3 should be lit up in blue. Press the button and hop down to shuttle 3 to escape. SECRET#8: During the escape sequence when the explosions are going off, you can make a detour into the hallway that connects OPS with the cargo bay. There’s a Moon Key door that has Super Armor behind it. If you are quick enough you should be able to get this and still have time to escape.




<<< E2M4: Weird Science >>>

Jump from your ship into the sea. Swim to the right of the cliff where Tchernobog waits and kill the Cultist in the boat. A Gill Beast will be summoned while you are making you are way over to the boat so be ready. Swim to the dock and lure the Hell Hound near the Flare gun into the water. Grab the supplies and Diving Suit then head up to the top of the cliff on the big lift. Grab the ammo by the corpse and walk towards Tchernobog. Dodge the fireballs, after which the doors to the castle will open releasing various Cultist types. Enter the castle and you will be in an area we will call the Statue Hall.

If you destroy the hand statue a Life Seed will appear along with many Choking Hands, so use an explosive. SECRET#1: The high walkway to the right has a broken wall near the fire. Jump inside the fire area and hit the switch to reveal some Body Armor and ammo nearby. Jump in the water to get the Fire Key. SECRET#2: Swim down the long underwater tunnel. In the middle there is a Napalm Launcher and a Diving Suit so you can get back without drowning. Get out of the water and go to the Fire Door. Continue to the library where you will find a Tome. When you pick it up a hidden entrance will appear to the dungeon. Head down the spiral stairs, eliminating the Acolytes on your way. SECRET#3: At the opening halfway down the stairs, you should be able to see Tchernobog standing on a ledge. Make the big jump over to him (it may sap some health) to get some supplies. At the bottom of the stairs you need to kill the Hell Hounds quickly. Use Tesla ammo if you have it. SECRET#4: Above the Shotgun ammo there is a stone face. Shoot it to open one of the dungeon cells that contains some ammo. Enter the earthen, cobwebbed area to get the Spider Key for entering the torture chamber. SECRET#5: On the opposite side of the area that contains the Key is a grate you can destroy that will allow you to enter a hidden room containing Key 7, which you will need to enter the secret level. Go to the torture chamber. Go up the staircase to the balcony. SECRET LEVEL ACCESS: If you turn left you will find a switch that requires the Moon Key - you will be returning here later to access the secret level. Grab the Skull Key and fall into the water. Climb out before the Gill Beasts can hurt you.

Before entering the ghost hall through the back entrance you may want to shoot out some of the windows from outside and throw some TNT into the dining room - it is full of enemies. Enter the rear entrance to the ghost hall. Do not get near the ghost in the hall or a Phantasm will appear. The door to the right has some Spirit Armor, which you will want to grab. The doors on the left lead to the dining room. Mow down the Cultists to the left to obtain the Eye Key. SECRET#6: On the right there is a metal saucer behind some hanging bodies. Blow up the saucer to reveal some ammo and items. Head back out the Fire Door toward the statue hall and go left. Open the gate with the Eye Key and go up the ramps. SECRET#7: At the bottom of the ramps there is a breakable stone decoration that will reveal a passage with a Life Leech. Continue across the wooden bridge to the storm tower and grab the Moon Key at the summit. Head back to the Moon Door (near the Fire Door) and continue past it to the mission’s end. SECRET LEVEL ACCESS: If you want to get to the secret level, ignore the Moon Door and head back to the balcony past the torture chamber. Use the Moon Key on the switch up there to lower the pillars placed in the water area. Jump across the tops of the pillars until you come to a secret entrance. There are 2 Hell Hounds just inside the entrance so be sure to bomb them ahead of time or just fall back in the water if you catch on fire fighting them with bullets or shells. Proceed to the elevator and use Key 7 to enter the secret level (E2M10).




<<< E2M5: The Grapes of Wraith >>>

Move forward and clear out the red chapel area. There are several Fanatics and Cultists in the chapel so beware. In the next room you will see the Skull door on the left and exits to the right and straight ahead. Go right and kill the Cultist outside. SECRET#1: Behind one of the pillars in this area (facing out toward the rain) you will see a switch. Press it to reveal some hidden Body Armor. Keep going past the dark hallway back outside and you will find the Skull Key. Use it to open the Skull Door, being careful not to get sliced by the Phantasm waiting just beyond. The next room has a forklift. Use the switch on it to move the lift toward the window, then use the lift as a stepladder to reach the window ledge. SECRET#2: From here you can jump onto a nearby barrel shelf and go into a vent with Limited Invisibility. Go outside the open window near where the forklift stopped and through the silo to a large outdoor area with some blue lights. Grab the Eye Key from the Zealot and return inside. You can now access the upper walkway area from where Fanatics were firing at you earlier. Proceed through several doors. Shoot the barrel in the storage room and it will blow open a passage to the next section. 

To the left are some enemies and a moss-covered temple. You will be going to the right through a cavelike area first. At the end of the cave will be a hole in the wall that gives access to a sewage tunnel. SECRET#3: Jump over the sewage to the upper platform to get some Basic Armor and a Napalm Launcher, which will make the next part of the mission easier. Head into the sewage (with a powerful weapon handy for the Gill Beasts) and you will come to a break in the pipe ceiling. Emerge from the opening and you will find yourself in the vineyard. Some enemies will be coming down the slope to attack you. At the top of the hill is the winery. SECRET#4: Before you go in, jump on the barrel near the rock wall to find some Reflective Shots sitting over the ledge. The Dagger Key is on the long tasting table on the inside-left, but you will have to plow through some serious resistance before you can reach it safely. SECRET#5: On the opposite side of the winery from the tasting table (to the right of a large window) there is a hidden switch up on the ledge. Hit it to reveal some explosive ammo and Spirit Armor. Now that you have the Dagger Key, return to the moss-covered temple and enter it. Head right out of the entrance area into the orange-lit room. Turn left and press on the lion slab to lower it. Descend to the bottom of the shaft to the next orange room. SECRET#6: If you press on the lion slab right ahead in the lower room you will reveal a hidden Tesla Cannon. Proceed to the green water pool and grab the Fire Key. Return to the main entrance and head up the opposite passageway with the stairs. SECRET#7: If you jump across the green water to the dirt hill and look on the right, you will see a switch on the white stone wall. Press it to obtain some Tommy Gun & Tesla ammo. Use the Fire Key on the switch at the top of the stairs to open the stone gateway across the wooden bridge. Return to the main entrance and cross the bridge. SECRET#8: While crossing, look behind you toward the ceiling. You will see a stone face that you can shoot to reveal a hidden Life Seed. After obtaining it you may need to jump into the green water pool to return to the main entrance. Open the doors past the gateway and continue to the end of the mission. 




<<< E2M6: Deep-Sixed >>>

SECRET#1: There's a secret right near the beginning of the hallway where 2 Zombies are located. Break the potted plant near the wall and you will see a gray switch behind it. Use it to open a door in the stone wall, giving you access to Body Armor. You will come to a large structure resembling an open mouth. Hit the switch inside to open the doorway to the cellar directly behind it. Near the skylight of the cellar's central pillar is a hidden switch. Shoot it to open the middle pillar which hides Reflective Shots. From the cellar entrance there are several paths leading to the location of 5 Black Chests that you will need to open the large pink door. Here are the locations:

* This task can be done out of order *
1. Face the pink door. Head left and go forward until you reach a room with a large bonfire in the center. A chest is on a nearby cart.

2. Face the pink door. Head left and go up a nearby slanted ramp, then take the first left into a room with 3 skylights. The chest is near the table. When you grab it Zombies will emerge from 3 passages. SECRET#3: Enter the center passage and press on the wooden wall to reveal a Life Leech.

3. Face the pink door. Head left and take the first right. Go straight until the pathway curves and you come to a room with a floating head orbited by bodies. The chest is on the far end of the room. Make sure you have explosives before attempting this room, as you will have to fight off a Zombie swarm.

4. Face the pink door. Head right through the furthest passage (with the stairway). Enter the room at the end of the walkway and grab the chest inside.

5. Face the pink door. Head right through the closest passage (with the boat). SECRET#4: If you look at the rock wall to the right you will see a crack in the wall. Bomb it to reveal a Tesla Cannon. SECRET#5: If you go underwater near the place where the boat begins you will see a tunnel leading to a Life Seed. Ride the boat to the little island and grab the chest. Be careful — enemies appear when you take the chest. SECRET#6: If you continue past the island into the water, you will see an underwater cave on your left, which holds a Napalm Launcher. Ride the boat back from whence you came.

Return to the pink door and walk up to it. If you have all 5 Black Chests it will open, releasing a horde of rats. Jump in the pool of water behind them and swim to the next area.

When you get outside, you will see a ghost ship, a few houses, and a lighthouse with a flashing beacon. Go to the boat dock. SECRET#7: From here you can jump to the roof of a nearby house. Travel from that roof to the roof of a smaller house behind it near the rock wall where you can gather some hidden items. Enter the ghost ship through an opening adjacent to the center mast. Once inside, face the green hanging cloth. Head left and enter the upturned dining room, which is filled with enemies around every turn, rather than going to the 2nd floor. Grab the Eye Key from the back corner of the room and head to floor 2. In this bedroom you must kill the Phantasm. This will open a passage at the bed's headboard, allowing you to enter the sunken ship. Enter the water and go to the opposite end of the boat (the kitchen) where you will find the Skull Key behind a panel requiring the Eye Key for access. SECRET#8: On the way back, stop in the underwater area filled with floating boxes. Turn immediately left and you will find a switch on the back of a wooden box stack. Use it to reveal Super Armor and some Tommy Gun ammo. Backtrack to exit the sunken ship and the ghost ship. Go to the lighthouse and take the Skull Elevator to the top. Grab the Moon Key and go back down. Use the Moon Key on the other elevator, which will carry you down to the end of the mission.




<<< E2M7: Paradise Lost >>>

Paradise Lost is going to be the most challenging map you have come across in this episode. There is a lot of scenery look at but make sure you keep your eyes out for enemies, too. Walk out of the cave and continue through the crystal cavern. You will come to the entrance of a stone fortification where light is flooding out. We will refer to this as the "fort." There is some water you will be heading into flowing under the fort, and if you have some spare ammo dive down there now and take out the Gill Beasts behind the bars. SECRET#1: There is also a hidden stash of goodies if you face the underwater bars and swim forward and to the left. Enter the fort and clear out the enemies. Drawing the Hell Hounds out into the water is useful if you are low on ammo. SECRET#2: If you enter the fort and make an immediate right you will be by a serpent panel. Open it to reveal a Life Seed. Go to the space behind the brown glass window and use the "water gate" switch. This opens the underwater bars. Go back out to the blue area, swim past the bars, and go left (straight ahead are some helpful supplies just outside the water surface). Come out of the water and you’ll be in a big hall with barrels along the far wall. Take the elevator in this hall up to a rooftop area with orange lighting surrounded by a pool. Go straight ahead to get the Fire Key on the pool’s rim. Return to the fort and enter the Fire Door. There is a Zealot on the other side so be ready to fire.

Go up the steps and travel until you see Tchernobog. When you get close a band of Zombies is going to crawl out of the ground. Alt fire Spray Can works wonders here. Eventually a wall behind the Zombies will lower allowing you to continue along a ledge by the blue crystal section you passed earlier, then to a new outside area with a waterfall. Be careful not to fall off. SECRET#3: There is a corpse outside with a bloody handprint you will want to press to open a stone wall. Behind it you can grab some Fire Armor and a Napalm Launcher. Get the Dagger Key and open the nearby gate. Return to the first floor of the the fort and go in the Dagger Door. A Choking Hand will pop out of a little vase. Ahead Tchernobog will appear again. Get close and he will turn into several enemies.  Open the gate with your Dagger Key and run into the cave ahead. There is a corpse outside that drops Guns Akimbo. SECRET#4: Before diving into the cave's pool, search the cave for a secret passage that will give you some health and Invisibility. Hop in the cave pool and quickly swim straight ahead until you see the surface of the water. When you emerge on the other side you will be able to see the shore to the right. SECRET#5: If you go to the left underwater you will find a secret alcove with some nice items and a Life Leech. Past the shore is a large area with lots of enemies and lots of room to maneuver yourself. One of the Stone Gargoyles in this wide-open area will open the gate at the far end, revealing the Spider Key and the path back to the first floor of the fort. Enter the Spider Door. Navigate through the supply room and take the Moon Key. Return to the main area (now filled with Zombies) and go through the Fire Door. Go back to the Dagger Gate you raised earlier in the mission and enter the Moon Door just past it. Jump down the hole in the ground and you will land in some water. Walk towards the light. Tchernobog will launch some fireballs at you. Keep walking ahead to the end of the mission.




<<< E2M8: The Black Tower >>>

Grab the weaponry to the left after you exit the cave and head through the rest of the forest. When you emerge from the trees you will be able to see the black tower and the battleground that lies before it. There are 2 battalions out here: One in the center that will engage you immediately and a second that will approach when you get closer to the tower. Also in the center is Tchernobog, who will summon a batch of Zombies when you get close enough to the tower. Save your Tesla ammo for the tower entrance. At the mouth of the tower (literally) there will be some fire pods and more Zombies when you get close. SECRET#1: Go behind the tower to get a Life Leech. SECRET#2: On the left side of the mouth there is a hidden entrance with Fire Armor and a Life Essence. When you step into the center of the mouth a wall will open releasing Cerberus and some hounds. Unload your Tesla Cannon on Cerberus. If you run out of ammo, keep moving backward while firing - you will have lots of space. You can try blowing Cerberus off the cliff to his death but it is pretty tough to do. Once he's dead you will be able to enter the tower. Go around the corner and step into the glowing light. You will be transported to the tree gallery. Each tree acts as a portal to a unique area. In each area you will need to hit a skull-shaped switch. The order in which you activate them is irrelevant. Once you hit all 5 you will be able to use the floor portal in the main gallery area to exit back to the tower interior. SECRET#3: Activate the stone face behind the 2 Gargoyles to open a panel near the glowing light revealing Super Armor. Go to the new area that has opened up and drop down the hole to the right into sub level 1 of the tower. 

Go into the next room and pick up the Tesla Cannon on the ground. Proceed across the  invisible bridge, dodging (by hopping through) Tchernobog's fireball rings. Cross to the other side and head down the ramps in the lava filled area to tower sub level 2. SECRET#4: There is a Gargoyle nest at the top of the lava area that you can jump to, but be very careful as the lava will instantly burn you to death. The reward is significant. Journey across sub level 2's invisible bridge to the doorway with lava falls on each side. There is a Stone Gargoyle flying up above that you will need to kill. When the Stone Gargoyle is dead, fight your way into the room with the invisible floor above a lava flow. Move around the ring-shaped hallway and hop into the glowing light. You will be transported outside of the tower where you will have to fight your way back inside. Enter the tower, head right and go up the stairs instead of heading left through the dark archway where you went last time. Take the elevator up to the tower's top floor. You will see the Fire Key as the path ends. SECRET#5: The wall in shadow by the Napalm Launcher has a handprint on it. Press it to reveal a secret ammo stash. When you grab the Fire Key the area is going to flood with monsters, so you may want to lay around some Proximity or Remote Mines beforehand. Head back to the room with the invisible floor above a lava flow on sub level 2. Enter the fire door, descend to sub level 3, and walk through the lava tunnel. The mission ends shortly after. 




<<< E2M9: Legion >>>

Walk into the cave and grab the ammo. Crawl through the rock tunnel and head right at the steps to grab some ammo at the top. SECRET#1: There’s a small ledge on the side of the stairway by the lava. Go down there for a Doctor’s Bag and Basic Armor. There’s a switch right by the items that will raise the ledge so you can get back on the stairs. The bottom of the stairway will lead to an invisible bridge. When you are nearly on the bridge Tchernobog's specter will launch some fireballs your way. You will want to be away from the back wall when dodging them. Tchernobog will explode when you get close. Go to the next room and you will see another specter. This one will summon some Zombies. Attack them and wait for the door on the side to open. The big battle begins!

Fight the enemies that appear until Cerberus appears. SECRET#2: If you jump off the top of the altar (where the heart is floating) onto the rock wall, you can run along the top to the right until you reach a hidden Napalm cache. SECRET#3: If you run to where Cerberus emerged you can go left onto a hidden ledge for a Life Leech, Super Armor, and Jump Boots. Killing Cerberus will trigger the next wave of adversaries. After some time another rock will drop down releasing some more enemies and a Stone Gargoyle. Killing the Stone Gargoyle will end the mission.




<<< E2M10: Dread Faction (Secret Level) >>>

When the elevator stops, head straight ahead and take the lift up at the end of the sewer. Go around the corner and head into the rock area with a large metal gate. Go left and hit the switch to raise it, then hop into the cargo car of the underground train. Use the control panel by the sleeping Zombie then head to the back where the doors will open exposing the Skull Key. Use it to open the gate on the opposite side of the car to proceed to the storage car. Lower the elevator to the left first, bomb the Cultists riding the platform, then open the gate and head up to the kitchen. Grab the Eye Key in the kitchen and be sure to check the fridge for health. SECRET#1: Press on the bloody handprints near the elevator to reveal some Flares. SECRET#2: There is a Life Seed in the furnace. Go back down the elevator and head to the dining car through the Eye Doors. The Fire Key lies behind the next set of double doors past the dining area. SECRET#3: In the dining area there is a serpent panel near the entrance to the food car with a VooDoo Doll behind it. Head back to the food car and open the fire door. Grab the Dagger Key and go back to the food car. Continue forward until you open the Dagger Door and reach a locked door behind 2 Zealots. Climb around the ledge and get atop the head of the train so you can jump down from the roof into the engine room. Once in the engine room, hit the 2 switches and stand on the opposite side of the room before the train crashes. SECRET#4: Before hitting the switches, you can run into the furnace and grab a Life Seed, which is all the way in the back hidden behind some fire. Move along through the wrecked train and the sewer to the facility rail cart.

Ride it to the facility and move into the steam/disinfection room past the Phantasm. Press on the control panel to start the sequence. When you hear the chime a door will open to a large room made up of 4 pathways. At the center is a key panel where you will open up the blue, red, and white sections (in that order as you obtain a key from each area you enter). Zombies are here in enormous numbers, and will return with reinforcements each time you complete a colored section (along with Gill Beasts in some areas). Activate the blue section first with the Dagger Key you obtained earlier.

Blue:
One door leads to some supplies. The next is a small room with some cryo tubes. Hit the switch on the computer panel wall and grab the Moon Key. Return to the key panel and use the Moon Key.

Red:
One door leads to a diving suit. The next is a large room with a large cryo-water tank. Ride the elevator down then press on the computer panel at the end of the walkway. The water level will rise high enough for you to jump in without injury. Swim to the bottom and grab the Spider Key. SECRET#5: On the ride back using the elevator you will be able to hop onto the far ledge across the gap without hitting your head on the ceiling. There are some Tesla supplies behind the waste barrels. Return to the key panel and use the Spider Key.

White:
One door leads to some supplies. The next is a small room with some cryo tubes like the blue section. Hit the switch on the wall with the danger sign to open the final pathway behind the key panel. There is a deluge of baddies in there so ready your explosives. 

At the back of the pathway the door is locked, so you will be heading into a vent near the doorway. Crawl through and blast the Zombies. SECRET#6: Behind them in the corner near the couch is some hidden Spirit Armor. Head down the elevator where you entered the train depot and get ready to take down the final wave of Zombies. Get your Napalm Launcher out for this or you could easily get trapped. Run the elevator ahead where the mission ends.  




<<< E2M11: Behemoth (Transition Level, Returns you to E2M5) >>>

Once you move across the back entrance to the castle you will have a variety of Cultists and Cerberus on your tail. Blast the Zealots if you need Tesla ammo. Cerberus will drop a Moon Key upon death. Use it to head through the Moon Door that leads to the experimental chamber. The mission ends shortly afterward. SECRET#1: Go into the water pool in the former hand statue room and dive in. You will find a Medicine Pouch behind a gate.




********** EPISODE 3: WAR IS HELL **********




<<< E3M1: Whisper Peak >>>

Head out of the bathroom and journey until you reach the boathouse. SECRET#1: If you hop into the chimney you will find a disturbing room with a Life Seed. SECRET#2: On the far side of the boathouse shore you can grab a Flare Pistol. Take the boat across the lake and proceed to the town. SECRET#3: You can jump off the first parked vehicle you see and land over a nearby wall to collect some hidden Proximity and Remote Mines. SECRET#4: A very useful Life Leech is located behind the sign at the corner of the road. Walk along the road until you get to the Skull Key sitting next to a radio. Use it to enter the pub and head out the exit door behind the bar. Get the Eye Key and hop on the trash bin. SECRET#5: You can hop off the top of the bin into a nearby window to get Basic Armor. Jump off the bin over the fence and go to the mechanic's shop across from the pub. Open the gate with the Eye Key then head up the stairs. Open the back gate, which will give you access to the rear of the building but also releases a Hell Hound (don’t waste your Flares on it). Out back you will jump into a well to get the Fire Key, giving you access to the school. 

Head into the school (the white building with a clock mounted on the front) and take the first right into classroom 100 to get some ammo before continuing. SECRET#6: There is a bloody locker on the left side of the school’s main hallway that you can press on to reveal Body Armor. Go right at the end of the hall. Outside you will find a Black Chest. Once you touch it, head back inside and down the new dark hallway. Keep going until you reach the new area with Gill Beasts, or "normal floor." Take the first right into the goo, or "goo floor," then swim straight across to the Dagger Key. Return to normal floor and use the Dagger Key on the wall switch. Go to goo floor and enter the last doorway on the left (there is a diving suit nearby where the Gill Beast emerged). Hit the switch near the desk. There is a Gill Beast who will drop a Life Essence around the corner where the spikes are placed if you have low health and spare ammo. Return to normal floor. Head through the open mouth passage. Continue into the next mouth passage ahead to be whisked away to the end of the mission.      




<<< E3M2: The Room >>>

You will start in the apartment, which resembles a living unit from E1M7. Go to the front door. Shortly afterward the bathroom door will open up. You will find a hole in the wall. Climb in and you will be transported to subway world. Go left and get inside the ticket booth to open the terminal gate. Now you can get on the track. SECRET#1: If you go right behind the rail-block you will see a switch that will reveal a hidden Life Leech inside a pillar. Do not travel down that track into the darkness to the right or a train going the wrong way will run you down. If you head left you will see a Skull Key. Quickly grab it and run into the nearby alcove before you get crushed. Open the Skull Door down where the Zombies rise up next to the track. SECRET#2: You can hop off the head of a Zombie or a Rat to reach a small ledge in this area with Limited Invisibility. Descend the stairs past the Skull Door, go under the tracks, and up the elevator.

Straight ahead through the door you will see a Shotgun. Grab it and kill the Acolyte. SECRET#3: To the right of the Acolyte on the right is a metal panel with flecks of green on it. Press it to reveal a passage with a Life Seed. SUPER-SECRET: In this same area with the Life Seed you will see 3 gated pillars labeled “DANGER”. Break the grate furthest to the left and jump into the opening. This is a tricky jump you may want to save your progress. Inside you’ll find Reflective Shots, Napalm supplies, a Doctor’s Bag, and Jump Boots. You won’t have to make the jump back — there is a switch near the pillar entrance that will raise the floor up. Now exit the area. SECRET#4: There is a giant blue SLOTH poster on the upper level of the main subway hall. You can jump through it to find a hidden supply stash. Clear the upper walkway, ignoring the lower subway area. Go to the ticket booth at end to open the sliding gate around the corner. The gate that moves will release a Hell Hound. Past the Hell Hound is a supply closet with a hole leading back to the apartment.

This time you will have to attack 3 shadow-like ghosts in the apartment to open up the bathroom. There is one on the couch, one in the kitchen, and one in the bedroom closet. SECRET#5: The bedroom bookshelf can be lowered by pushing it, revealing some ammo. Once the ghosts are gone, go into the bathroom and return through the (now much larger) hole back to subway world. Walk in the rain over to the stairs. Go up and grab the Dagger Key, which will open the gate ahead. SECRET#6: To your left you can press on the big poster, revealing Beast Vision and Invulnerability. Go to the far side of the big terminal (across the subway tracks) where you’ll see a gateway and a hallway lit in red. SECRET#5: Before entering, head down to the furthest phone booth and use it. A secret passage will open up which houses Body Armor. Return to the gateway and go inside. Go through the Dagger Door straight ahead and turn left. The ghost nearby is going to transform into some Gill Beasts. Touch the wooden box under the flickering light and turn around. You will see a portal with green rings open up. SECRET#8: To your right is a broken elevator. If you can make it past the door without getting crushed you’ll collect a Napalm Launcher. Go through the green portal and you will arrive in the final, twisted version of the apartment, which you can finally leave through the front door. Watch out for the Zombies just outside the door to the left, then head right towards the door on the floating platform. Enter into the white light to end the mission.    




<<< E3M3: Shadehaven >>>

Cross the wooden bridges to Shadehaven's entrance. SECRET#1: If you hop on the ledge to your right and walk around the side of the giant structure you will find a little switch. This will lower a platform to take you up to a higher ledge. Follow the walkway around to the other side of the structure, leaping over the gap as you go. You will discover a hidden Life Seed. Return to the entrance. Hit the switches on each side of the entrance to unlock the front doors. Go inside. We will call this spot (where your back is to the entrance doors and you are facing the inverted cross) "Shadestart." Head to a flashing red elevator on either side of the inverted cross wall and ascend to the crystal room. Approach the inverted cross from this side of the structure and it will open up, allowing you to reach the Eye Key. Jump to grab it and fall in the golden water pool. Swim straight ahead into the next area through a tunnel and hit the submerged Eye Switch. This will open the portal directly ahead. Enter the portal and grab the Skull Key. SECRET#2: If you jump through the closest hanging wall cloth above the water you will obtain Body Armor. If you want you can jump in the water, grab the ammo scattered on the sandy floor, and swim back to the area with the Eye Switch & Portal so you can escape the water. Return to the crystal room and open the Skull Doors. Ride the elevator to Floor 2. 

Enter the blue hallway on the left and you will end up outdoors. Continue to the yellow stable, watching out for a Hell Hound that is extremely difficult to shoot due to the wooden fence. Go through the wooden door and pick up the Shrink Shroom at the end of the passage. Return to Shadestart. 

Go through the doorway on the right then down the blue checkered stairs. Straight ahead is a hole in the wall near the floor. When you approach this area (now that you have the Shrink Shroom) you will be able to access the section with the Fire Key. SECRET#3: There is another, larger hole in the wall next to the small one that leads outdoors. Go outside and you will see a tiny switch on the dark outer wall. Press it to reveal some nearby ammo. When you are in the shrunken area, go straight through the opening in the wall. SECRET#4: If you need Fire Armor, walk behind some of the other floor pieces in this area before continuing. This is your only chance to get this secret since you won’t be able to return here after getting the Grow Shroom. Grab the Fire Key. When you do, a wall will open revealing a cavern with tiny blue lights. Take the Grow Shroom from the center and exit the area, after which you will return to normal size. Open the nearby gate with the Fire Switch, then proceed until you reach the Fire Elevator, which will return you to Floor 2 (you can also take the Skull Elevator from earlier).

Enter the hall with the neutral/white colored light. Kill the enemies and hit the Fire Panel, which will unlock the 2 elevators in the room. SECRET#5: If you take the closest elevator to the outdoor area overlooking a previous part of the mission, you can locate a switch behind a rock pillar which will reveal some Proximity Mines and Basic Armor. Afterward, return to the area with the Fire Panel. Go to the far elevator and ride it up. Walk ahead until you get to the Fire Door. Pass through and go up the stairs and into the portal at the end of the hall. Now you are in the inverted hall where you can reach the Dagger Key and a second portal to the left of it. Grab the key and enter the new portal. You will fall into a pool of water by the metal grating. Use your new key to lower the gate outside the pool and reenter the main Floor 2 area. 

Go left into the Butcher's Dining Hall. Use your key on the Dagger Door in the back and kill the Spiders just beyond inside the 4-way hall. SECRET#6: If you crawl through the Spider hole you can get some Spirit Armor. If you go down the left hallway you can pick up some ammo. SECRET#7: In the ammo room there is a switch hiding just above the entrance. Hit it to lower the shelf nearby for a Life Essence and Guns Akimbo. The door opposite the dining room in the 4-way hall leads to a long passage with flashing red lights. At the end of the hall is the Spider Key. When you take it Phantasms will appear so be ready, especially since the entrance door opens slowly. Return to the main area of Floor 2 and go to the center where the 4 pillars and skylight are located. Hit the 3 Spider Switches and then the skull-faced switch. The floor will rise up, giving you access to the roof. On the roof, proceed to the vessel near the rock wall to find the end of the mission.




<<< E3M4: Bogey Beach >>>

Exit the vessel and the bookstore, then grab the Shotgun and turn right - a vehicle with Cultists will be heading your way. Blast them and break into the little office building. The hallway to the left has the Skull Key. SECRET#1: In front of the center chair at the meeting table is a tiny switch near the floor. Press it to lower some filing drawers which conceal an Invulnerability item. You may want to save this secret until you’re ready to go onto the boardwalk area. Grab the Skull Key and head outside. There is some ammo laying on the beach so get that before you leave the area. SECRET#2: Behind one of the gray brick walls down on the beach is a Basic Armor guarded by a hidden Gill Beast. Go into the alley next to the office and hit the skull switch, which will open the large gate on the other side of the wall. Go there, and take the ramp up to the boardwalk.

To the left is the main stretch. SECRET#3: If you go straight ahead and jump into the ocean you will come across a drowned corpse next to some Napalm ammo. Down the main stretch, take as many enemies down from afar as you can manage, just as you did at the beginning of The Black Tower. SECRET#4: Behind the Fry Shack is a Limited Invisibility. You will need to jump off the waste bins or an enemy to get over the fence. The Fry Shack has some ammo inside. The boardwalk-side entrance to the office is locked so you will have to break through the window to get the Tesla Cannon. The Gameland arcade has some dangerous foes in it so be sure to clear it out. SECRET#5: If you crawl under the bars of the Skee Free game you will see a switch the the top. Press it to open a panel with Body Armor behind it. Go to the open area with the light posts and the Eye Key. SECRET#6: Before you grab the key by Tchernobog destroy the garbage on the right of the trash bin. You will be able to get into a small hole that leads to Asbestos Armor. SECRET LEVEL ACCESS: See that gray brick wall between the 2 stands and the bait shop? You need to get over that. Jump off the trash bun nearby or go to the left stand and climb on the boxes beside it so you can jump to the roof of the stand. Hop to the roof of the right stand and then leap over the wall. You will get Key 7, which is needed to reach the secret level later. Grab the Eye Key. When you do, Tchernobog will float away, leaving you to fight some Hell Hounds and Acolytes. Go to the liquor store around the corner and grab the Fire Key inside. Do not run in too hastily or you will get shot up by the fanatics behind the cash registers. Go to the bait shop. The top floor is empty, but the bottom has the key room, which you will need your Eye and Fire Keys to enter completely. The back of the boat floating by the bait shop has a shutter you can lower to get a Diving Suit and a Flare Pistol. SECRET#7: If you drop into the water you will find some ammo hiding under the boat, but it is a long swim back to shore. SECRET#8: Starting at the boat, walk across the gate and onto the gray brick wall, then head over to where the Acolytes are/were throwing dynamite. You will find a Life Seed. Go into the bait shop key room and take the Dagger Key, which gives you access to the hotel on the other end of the boardwalk. 

Enter the hotel and continue until you have the Spider Key. Go back where you came from and you will find that the path has changed. Grab the Moon Key at the bottom of the swirling platforms and then return to the hotel entrance. Exit the hotel and return to the boat. Press on the boat's cabin door to end the mission. SECRET#9: However, if you'd prefer to go to the secret level, go to the liquor store. Shoot out the large window and jump across the water to the ledge with the gate. Enter the opening and proceed to the spider door. Inside you will find 3 boxes of Flares. See the row of switches? Pull the one labeled "7," which requires Key 7. A ventilation shaft will open. Duck into it. On the other side you will find yourself on the roof of a building. Search around the roof and you will see a tiny green ring. Touch it and you will be sent soaring to the secret level (E3M9).    




<<< E3M5: Duck & Cover >>>

Duck & Cover will be your first big challenge in this episode. There are a lot of firefights with large numbers of foes, and you will have to develop a strategy that works best for you in each situation, as your tactics will vary greatly depending upon whether or not you brought a lot of long-range weaponry into this mission from your previous efforts. Grab the Flare Pistol and wait for the door to get destroyed. Go outside where you will see the fortified shoreline. SECRET#1: Shimmy around the ledge of the boat to the back and lower the shutter for some Remote Mines that will really prove useful if you are low on shells and bullets. Swim to shore and kill the Hell Hounds. SECRET#2: There is an Acolyte wandering around atop a tiny guard post on the beach. Hop from the wall to the tank deterrent to his platform for some Body Armor. 
Head into town for the first big battle. SECRET#3: The first building on the corner to your right can be entered by jumping off the waste bin. Once up there, press the bookshelf to reveal some Reflective Shots. SECRET#4: Behind the building that has toppled over you will find some Shotgun ammo and Basic Armor. Enter the building with the hole in the side from an air strike. Get the Skull Key, grab the TNT from the area where Zombies emerge, and then leave the structure. Go straight ahead past the gates. Do not get near that red beeping box - it is a powerful, armed proximity mine! Lure the Zombies lurking nearby to it. Grab the Doctor's Bag in the phone area then head to the ticket booth for the museum. Get in the booth and use your Skull Key on the switch to unlock the elevator. Ride up to the museum. 

The great hall of the museum is littered with Fanatics. After you kill one of the Cultists at the front desk they will start to scurry around from their hiding places behind the pillars. When you get to the big Tchernobog statue, go up the stairway and descend the ramp created by a fallen building. As you go down, you will see some enemies to the right. One drops Guns Akimbo, which you may want for the firefight coming up. SECRET#5: To the left of the building-ramp is a stone ledge. Walk along that ledge and you will come to a Life Leech. At the bottom of the building-ramp you will have another battle. Watch out for the hidden Cultists in the alleys between buildings. SECRET#6: Behind the long building with the vent on top you can get your hands on a Napalm Launcher and some Tommy Gun bullets, but watch out for the armed mines laying on the ground. When the battlefield is clear open the supply room door and get the Fire Key. Go back to the T-Bog statue. Take a left into the middle gallery. Entrances on your right and left will lead to the upper and lower galleries. Descend to the lower gallery if you need a Life Seed, but it’s trapped! In the upper gallery, use your Fire Key on the big pillar to obtain the Spider Key.  SECRET#7: One of the paintings in the upper gallery can be moved by pressing on it, revealing Fire Armor and Proximity Mines. Return to the museum entrance elevator and go back down to the ticket booth area.

Turn right and use the Spider Key to enter the brick building. There is Hell Hound right around the corner so toss some explosives ahead of you before entering. Climb up the wreckage and jump atop the slanted ledge of the adjacent building.

There are 2 secrets clustered in this area:

SECRET#8: Jump from those same pillars or from one of the smoking pipes into the exposed, upper-level apartment hallway. Out on the ledge next to it (near where the wall was destroyed earlier in the level when you first saw the beeping mine) there is a Life Seed. 

SECRET#9: Jump on the other, higher pillars close by. Leap from there to the open window where the glass has been shattered. You will find a Doctor's Bag. 

Near the slanted ledge you will see a window you can jump through. Do so, then take the elevator hidden behind the wall down to the bomb shelter. SECRET#10: There is a shelf you can press down there on the right as you go through the wrecked doorway which will reveal an ammo cache. Get the Dagger Key from the back room and escape the bomb shelter before it goes up in smoke. Take the Dagger Elevator to the top floor. Tchernobog is going to spawn some pests if you get close to be sure to throw an explosive his way first. Take the Moon Key and make your way outside the building down to the area near the phone where Zombies are now running around. Use the Moon Key on the radio next to the wall to call in an air strike. The explosion will destroy the wall by the phone, allowing you to reach the minefield. If you get close to one of the gray boxes you will take major (if not lethal) damage, so shoot or bomb them ahead of time. You will see a hole in the rock wall across the minefield that you will need to reach. Enter it and you will be on your way to the next mission.   




<<< E3M6: Inferno >>>

Run out of the cave and take the long elevator ride down. Jump in the lake and swim under the waterfall. You will reach a new area with 2 pools (they connect underwater). You may want to hop out from the far pool since you will emerge from the water behind some foes rather than in their sights. SECRET#1: Face the large Hell Hound gate and turn right. The 4th pillar by the water has a bloody handprint for you to press on one side, which will reveal a Life Seed. Hit the switch at the large gate where the Hell Hounds are trapped. If you are low on ammo simply lure them into the water. There’s a lift past the gate has two switches: One to lower the spikes around the lift and the other to raise/lower the elevator. You’ll need the Eye Key to lower the spikes, so grab the Skull Key for now and go into the other room.

Go straight ahead to the Skull Gate. Tchernobog, who stands in your path, will spawn some gargoyles. Past the gate there are 2 paths. Either way will lead you where you need to go, which is a long walkway with some Fanatics at one end. There is a small pool along this walkway. Jump in and grab the Eye Key. This will summon some Zombies outside the Skull Gate. SECRET#2: Before you return there go to the  doorway in shadow inside the room with the shining yellow light. Lower one of the bookshelves by pressing on it, then hit the switch behind it to open the wall up behind you. Inside the wall is Fire Armor. SECRET#3: Lower the bookshelf again, only this time leap from that bookshelf as it rises to the bookshelf across from it and out the window. Just outside the window is Limited Invisibility. Go back to the Eye switch that will lower the spikes surrounding the elevator and ride down.

There are many Cultists and Acolytes to dispose of on the walkway ahead, but most importantly is the Mother Spider. One well placed explosive attack will send her flying into the lava, killing her instantly and saving you a lot of ammunition. I suggest a normal dynamite toss directly in front of her (it may take a few tries to get her airborne). The path ends in a temple structure with several openings and the gateway to underworld (in the center of that giant mouth). We will call this structure “Fire Hub”. SECRET#4: One of the stone faces on a pillar is greenish instead of completely gray. Press it to open a panel where Asbestos Armor is hidden along with some ammo. On the left side of Fire Hub you will come to a window. From there you should be able to jump to a broken-up brick walkway. Enter the room at the end of the path and hit the twitch by the lava to activate the platforms. The platforms will start to move around. The lava will kill you instantly so time your jumps well to reach the room across the way. Grab the Dagger Key in the room beyond the platforms then return to Fire Hub. Go to the right side of Fire Hub and open the Dagger Gate. Cross the invisible bridge and obtain the Fire Key. SECRET#5: If you jump to the sandy area across the lava stream you will find a small tunnel, leading to a Hell Hound nest with some Tesla supplies and Key 7. Burst the corpse in this room for a Life Essence. Return to Fire Hub and use the Fire Key to open the central gateway down to the Underworld section inside the mouth. Jump in.

You will see 2 blue representations of creatures called "specters”. You will need to lead a creature of that type to the space. There are 2 ways to go down here: One side is used to summon Zombies and the other Gill Beasts. Touch the statues on each path to summon the corresponding creature. You will see the summoned creature as you make your way back to the main area with the specters. Lure the creature over the correct specter space and the plate will lower. Repeat this process for both creatures. SECRET#6: For the Gill Beast side only, if you face the statue and look left you will see a stone engraving. Break it apart and you will be given access to a secret room with a Life Leech. Once you have completed the task for both sides the mouth wall will open, releasing some Zealots and Cerberus. Inside the mouth there is an elevator down to the temple of flesh. If you choose to kill Cerberus to get a Life Seed, get the Tesla Cannons that the Zealots drop to make it fast. When he is dead, go down the elevator and go through the wind tunnel. You will be spit out into a vat of goo.

SECRET#7: If you are in the goo, face the direction of the wind tunnel and swim right, you will find a secret tunnel under the goo filled with goodies. When you emerge from the goo, get onto the shore and step into the space with the flickering light. The bone pillars will split, allowing you to go left or right. To the left is a Diving Suit, Basic Armor, and Napalm ammo. To the right is a split section containing 2 switches. The first switch is in a strange room with a transforming pit. Do not fall in! The second switch is under the 3 blood pools. Jump in one, then head through the right-side tunnel. Emerge from the blood and head forward through the self-dividing passage to reach the second of the two switches. Return to the flickering light, using the blood tunnel on the right as you journey back. The exit from the temple will now be available. Step onto the tongue and the mouth will open, revealing an open area with a boat as well as a few Cultists and Fanatics. When you get out to the boat, go into the water to grab the Moon Key. SECRET#8: If you jump over the water and onto the stone walkway, you can turn left and head into the water behind the metal bars to collect a Body Armor. There’s another room back here that has a Key 7 Switch which will take you to the secret level (E3M11) or you can return to the main area with the long boat. When you have the Moon Key, turn the steering wheel on the boat to end the mission.   




<<< E3M7: Last Rites >>>

SECRET#1: Hop in the water and take a swim to the sandy floor. You will see an opening at the bottom of the nearby structure that conceals Body Armor. Go back to shore. Grab the Tommy Gun and beware the lightning that will strike a nearby tree. Ahead, the path splits 2 ways. Straight ahead you should be able to see a Napalm Launcher, but it is better to head left for now. Steps will lead to an open area with a small water pool which contains a Life Essence should you require one.

By the time you reach the pool of water there will be Cultists coming from the right and the left. Before the ones from the right can reach you, fire at the TNT Barrels placed by the wall — the resulting explosion should kill several (if not all) of them if they’re close. Walk to the area where the Cultists from the right appeared, out near a walkway where you get a view of the clouds far below. Kill the Acolytes and grab the Napalm Launcher. SECRET#2: There is a stone face placed high on the wall out here. Shoot it and Reflective Shots will be revealed. Head back where you came from and go past the water pool to the top of the stairs. Get the Skull Key by the Fanatics. SECRET#3: In the same area, there will be some rocks you can climb on overlooking the water and the boat. Jump from there to the rock ledge by the metal fence. Run along the fence around to the other side. When you run out of room, you should be able to see a small opening nearby in the rock wall when you face the water gate. Jump to this opening (this can be tricky) and enter the cave. Inside you should find some valuable pickups. Return to the gate in front of the water pool. Open it. When you do, Tchernobog will laugh and explode, spawning Zombies. Behind him is the Hall Gateway. Kill the Zombies the head left around the corner. There are many enemies down this corridor, so be careful. Acolytes are positioned on high ground here, making them more dangerous than usual. You may need to duck down below the fallen pillar for cover. When the area is clear go up to the little building with the bright red floor. SECRET#4: Go the through it and head to the other side by the fence. There is a tiny face switch attached to the side of the building out here. Press it to open a stone panel where Super Armor hides. Go into the cave area, following the red floor until you come to a Wooden Chest. When you pick it up, the Hall Gate will open.

Beyond the gate is the Hall Path, with the Hall Foyer seated at the top of the stairs. When you walk down the path, Priest#1 (red-colored Cultist) will appear. When they lose all their health they will transform into Beasts. Use the Guns Akimbo item combined with Shotgun Blasts (alt fire) to push the Beast away from you, then use Tesla Cannon shots while it’s far away. You can also knock the Beast off the side of the cliff for an instant kill. When the Beast dies the entrance to the Hall Foyer will open, releasing a slew of baddies. Wipe them out and carefully enter the building, as there are probably a few that did not make it outside. Inside the foyer there are 6 stone slabs with skulls on them. SECRET#5: The center slab on the left (when facing the Foyer Throne) can be lowered when you press it, revealing some Body Armor and Beast Vision. Approach the foyer throne. Hit the false end-switch and some Butchers will be released along with a Mother Spider. Take out the Butchers first with explosives and then take on the Mother Spider. When she dies you will be able to progress past the Foyer to the Hall of Epiphany. SECRET#6: If you look past the fire on either side of the Foyer Throne you will see a stone engraving. These can be destroyed with an explosive, allowing you to access a hidden passage that leads to a Doctor’s Bag. After a confrontation with Tchernobog you will need to enter the Hall of Epiphany and go to the throne room on the far end to get the Eye Key. Priest#2 is in this room but will die from the explosions if you run in, so do NOT try to hurt the Priest from afar — after transforming into a Beast, the explosions will not be fatal. Take the Eye Key and return to the boat at the beginning of the mission. Priest#3 and a few other obstacles will be in your way. SECRET#7: On your walk back, before reentering the Foyer, there's a secret to pick up. Go to where Tchernobog transformed and face the foyer. Climb up the pink rocks to the left side of the foyer and move along the wall. You will find a golden face switch what will reveal Gasoline when pressed. 

If you get in the boat and face where the lightning struck at the beginning of the mission, the Eye Door will be on your right. When you open the Eye Door, Priest#4 will come after you. Past the Priest you will see a platform with a ladder next to it. Jump up there to get the Moon Key then return to the throne room in the Hall of Epiphany (where the explosions killed Priest#2). Use the key to lower the pillar in the center of the room, which will open the passage to the final mission.




<<< E3M8: Dead End (Final Boss Level) >>>>>>

When you get close to the floating island, hop off and let the battle begin! The stone pillars can be lowered by pressing on the switches at the back of the island. There are items below the green lights in 3 different places, but if you take any of them Zombies will appear below. You can also lower or raise the walls on the structure housing the green lights, which you may want to use to keep out of Tchernobog’s sight when he gets close. When Tchernobog is beaten, step into the portal.

Now in the Void-version of the Hall of Epiphany, fight your way to the throne room and defeat Tchernobog once again. When he is defeated, proceed past the throne into the tunnel of lights. You’ll be taken to the end of the mission. 




<<< E3M9: Nightmare (Secret Level) >>>

When you start the mission, you will notice that it resembles E1M1. This impression will not last. Grab the ammo in the downstairs closet. There is a Gill Beast right outside the front door, so have your Shotgun ready. Behind the house, there are 3 Cultists guarding a Black Chest. Collect it and return to the front of the house, where you will notice that the environment has opened up. You will see some slanted platforms leading to a doorway you will want to cross through. The Fire Armor sitting on the platform far away is deceptively difficult to reach without falling to your death, so only go for it if you are a jumping expert! Through the door there are 2 Zombies. This is "Firebelly room”, followed on the left by the “Jigsaw room”. Make sure you go into the Rat holding cell inside the Jigsaw room to take the Doctor's Bag. There are Hell Hounds just one the other side of this wall, so do not try to jump through the opening (although you can throw some explosives). SECRET#1: If you jump in the bathtub you will find that it is quite deep, with Body Armor at the bottom. Proceed to the “Furnace room” with the blood-filled boiler/furnace. Wipe out the enemies - you will be returning here. SECRET#2: If you hop in the boiler you can press on one of the walls to open it. You will find yourself rewarded with Limited Invisibility. Note the Moon Door in this room - you can come back here later for a Super Secret. Head outside and go through the window to the apartment bedroom. The closet has some items but grabbing them will summon a Phantasm near the bathroom. Go in the bathroom and head through the hole in the wall beside the bathtub. Note the translucent Gill Beast specter. Grab the Skull Key ahead and return to the Firebelly room.

Open the Skull Door and jump over the white flames to summon some Gill Beasts outside the room. Lead one through the Jigsaw room, through the gallery, and back to the translucent specter to open the wooden gate next to it. Carefully hop from one platform to the next until you make you way onto the floating vessel. There is a Life Essence sitting alone on a platform off to the side, but it is much easier to reach that platform than to escape it without falling to your doom. Enter the vessel's rear entryway. SECRET#3: Outside the windows there is a ledge with Reflective Shots. When you go out the front entrance of the vessel you will be fired on by several Fanatics. Beyond them lies a twisted chunk of E2M5 aka “Paradise room." To the left you will see find some Flares next to the Eye Door. SUPER-SECRET: Jump up to the windowsill. If you look across to the wall you will see an opening with the Moon Key inside. Grab the key and hit the switch on the wall, which will reveal a teleporter. Enter the teleporter and you will be transported back to the Moon Door in the Furnace room. Go through the Moon Door and collect everything you can in the area with red snow. You’ll see a cross outside the wall in this section. Next to it is another teleporter, but this one will take you back to the Paradise room. Head into the hall where the Gill Beasts were gathered, go up the stairs, and turn right. You will see a large, dark room. Once you step down into the room turn right for the Voodoo Doll, then advance toward the floating stack of ghosts. When you get close they will disappear and release 2 Stone Gargoyles and some Acolytes behind you. When the Stone Gargoyles are dead, a door at the far end of the room (near where the ghosts were) will open, revealing the Eye Key. Grab it and head back to the Eye Door inside the Paradise room. 

Follow the invisible walkway and you will end up back in the area where you just defeated the Stone Gargoyles, only now a new area directly across from you will be open. There is a small troop of varied Cultists who will begin their assault, so ready your long-range weapon of choice. You will find that this new area is like the rear castle entrance from E2M4. When you approach the floating demon in the distance it will transform into many Gargoyles and Zealots. SECRET#4: If you jump up the ascending string of pillars you will find an entrance to the side of the castle. Go through the entrance and defeat the Gargoyle so you can obtain some Tesla and Life Leech ammo. SECRET#5: If you go to the lit side of the cross in the main area you will see a switch where the 2 beams meet. This lowers a platform holding a Life Seed on the left side of the castle entrance). Inside the castle you will see a white ghost of Caleb. When you get close it will transform into a swarm of Tiny Calebs, so you may want to chuck a dynamite bundle at it. Go left into the cave. Move forward until you reach a giant face in the darkness which will carry you to the next mission. 




<<< E3M10: Morning Gory (Transition Level, Returns you to E3M5) >>>

You reawaken in the Low Tide Liquors of Bogey Beach. Grab the ammo in the store and exit. If you exit out via the hole in the wall you can get to a ledge with some Shotgun Shell Boxes. There is a trash can sitting by the side of the arcade. Break up the waste nearby and crawl through the tiny passage to claim some Proximity Mines. Down the boardwalk there is a battalion of Hell Hounds and Cerberus, who will drop a key upon death allowing you to exit the level at the front door to the docked boat. If you need more firepower, grab the Guns Akimbo out of the back of the boat. If you get desperate you can jump into the (now shallow) ocean area to escape a sticky situation.  

There are 4 secrets strewn about the mission. 
SECRET#1: In the water, just under the boat, is Fire Armor.
SECRET#2: Behind the "Fries" food stand an Asbestos Armor can be found.
SECRET#3: The hotel pool contains a Napalm Launcher (this will spawn 3 Zealots down the boardwalk).
SECRET#4: Climb over the brick wall where you found Key 7 in the Bogey Beach mission to get a Napalm Launcher.




<<< E3M11: Demon Isle >>>

Swim to shore. SECRET#1: If you climb up the rocks to the left you will be able to find a Voodoo Doll. This rock area is also accessible later on in the mission. Between the two big rock formations on the beach there is a path into a cave-like area with a sandy floor. Watch out for the Gill Beasts and grab the Shotgun ammo. This room will be called “CaveHub”. Break the stone face on the right, head up the stairs, and ride the vessel to the far platform. SECRET#2: While riding the vessel, if you turn to look where you came from you’ll see a gray, horned face above the opening. Shoot it to reveal a hidden stash with Body Armor. Press on the far platform’s column then either return on the vessel or wait for the rock formations to rise up and make a path. Return to CaveHub.

Break the stone face to left this time. Go up the elevator, across the bridges, press the stone face to unlock the elevator, and bring the elevator up. Go outdoors and collect some ammo, then take the elevator down. Kill the Hell Hound and taken another elevator down to the bottom. You’ll see some stepping stones. SECRET#3: In the opposite direction of the stones, around the corner, there is a hidden room with Super Armor. Go up the stones, grab the Skull Key, and return to CaveHub.

Two Skull Switches should know be available. Press both and then press on the gray column in front of the big door. Take the large vessel down to the next area. SECRET#4: On the ride down, you’ll see 3 fire pits in a line. The one in the center has Invulnerability. You’ll need to jump onto the wall near the pits if you want to reach them without taking fall damage. Go through the double-doors and into the room with a water-filled hole in the center. We’ll call this “Pool Room”. Hop in the water and located the Eye Key. Return to Pool Room. Go left to the sandy area. Hit all 3 Eye Switches that are grouped together, then press the stone-faced switch beside that group. Return to Pool Room. Go right, across the bridge, and up the elevator. Move the lever at the top. Ride back down and enter the red hallway on the right (behind the waterfall). SECRET#5: In the red hallway there is an Acolyte. Jump to where he was standing and hit a small red switch to reveal a Life Leech. Get the Dagger Key at the end of the hallway then return to Pool Room. Jump in the water and swim past where you picked up the Eye Key. Open the Dagger Gate and proceed through the pipe. You’ll be spat out into a large room with a few enemies guarding the mission exit door just outside the water.




<<< E3M12: The Dregs (Transition Level, Returns you to E3M7) >>>

Move forward and go out through one of the floor vents on the left or right. Go up the ramp. On the right you’ll see that you can walk on the exposed pipe and enter where the gate is broken on the left side of the building. SECRET#1: If you face the opposite direction, you can jump off the pathway down to the base of the wooden poles with wires attached. One of the poles has a switch on it that will open the nearby gate protecting a Napalm Launcher. Through the gate there is some water and another large gate made of wood. There is a switch in the room that will raise the wooden gate bit. Proceed past the small boat and up to the face-like stone structure. It will open when you get close. Beyond that and across the muck there’s a Moon Key. Return to the long boat and use the Moon Key on the steering wheel to end the mission.
