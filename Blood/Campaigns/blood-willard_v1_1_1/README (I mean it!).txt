IMPORTANT STUFF TO READ!

Willard is made to use the polymost renderer - if you don’t use it you will get a lot of graphical glitches. In NBlood go to video settings and change renderer from classic to polymost. 

There are a LOT of sprites (especially trees) in most of these maps. If you use a voxel pack I would seriously suggest you turn it off, unless you have some sort of super computer from the future that has travelled back in time to kill Sarah Connor or something.

It doesn’t really support difficulty settings as of now. It’s balanced using Lightly broiled and I also use version 1.0 weapon balancing for reference. 

There are a lot of readable notes in the maps and they all look like square shaped books (not the tome voxel!). These are important to read for some backstory and also hints sometimes!

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Extract Willard right under your blood folder. Everything should be in that ”Willard” folder, if it makes some files in a subfolder, simply move them to the ”Willard” folder. When you start NBlood, go down to ”Custom game content directory” and choose Willard. If you don’t get the intro movie, or if you get missing textures something has gone wrong with the above procedure. The bonus map "Fever Dream" is avaialable at the episode select screen. It's meant to be played afterwards, but I guess it could also be played before the episode, in which case parts of it will act as a sort of twisted premonition...

Enjoy!
