About
============================================================================================

Provides voxel replacements for the monster sprites in Blood, along with a few others. 
Every voxel frameis subject to updates and improvements as this mod progresses. 
The end goal of Coagulated is to eventually have every monster from Blood recreated
as faithfully as possible with voxels.

============================================================================================
INSTALLATION
============================================================================================

BuildGDX (1.04 and later) and NBlood (r2059 or later):
Put the zip into your autoload folder. DO NOT EXTRACT THE ZIP. Just place it in the autoload folder.
Make sure "enable autoload folder" checkbox is enabled

Raze (1.1.3 or later):
Drag and drop Blood_-_Coagulated.zip onto the Raze.exe and run Blood

***NOTE ON BLOODGDX***

It was reported by user LukasThyWalls on ModDB.com that there is strange palette anomalies that appear when runnings. 
A fix for this is to run BloodGDX in Classic Render mode, found in the options.
